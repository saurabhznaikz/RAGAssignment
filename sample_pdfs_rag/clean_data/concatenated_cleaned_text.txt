around the world More and more people whether managers of companies heads of nonprofits or leaders of government find themselves up against an ocean of bloody competition and want to get out Maybe your business is seeing its margins shrink Maybe competition is getting more intense driving commoditization of your offering and rising costs Maybe you know you are going to announce that salary increases wont be coming Thats not a situation any one of us wants to face And yet thats a situation that so many do face How can you address this challenge The lessons tools and frameworks of Blue Ocean Strategy will help you to meet this challenge whatever industry or economic sector you are in It shows how you can get out of a red ocean of bloody competition and into a blue ocean of uncontested market space characterized by new demand and strong profitable growth When we wrote Blue Ocean Strategy we used the metaphor of red and blue oceans because red oceans seemed to capture the reality that organizations increasingly face while blue oceans captured the endless possibility that organizations could create as industry history has borne out since its inception Today ten years later more than 35 million copies of the book have been sold It has become a bestseller across five continents It has been translated into a recordbreaking fortythree languages And the term blue ocean has entered the business vernacular Over four thousand articles and blog posts on blue ocean strategy have come out with new articles continuing to appear daily worldwide The stories they contain are fascinating There are articles from small business owners and individuals across the globe that discuss how the book fundamentally changed their perspectives on life and took their professional successes to all new levels In other articles executives speak of how blue ocean strategy provided the insight to take their business out of the red ocean and create all new demand And yet other articles detail how government leaders have applied blue ocean strategy to achieve high impact at low cost with rapid execution in areas of social importance ranging from enhancing the quality of rural and urban lives to strengthening internal and external securities to breaking down ministerial and regional silos1 As we have reached out to organizations that have applied the ideas and have worked with many directly since the publication of the original edition of Blue Ocean Strategy we have learned a lot by watching the journey people have made with these ideas Their most pressing questions in executing their blue ocean strategies are How do we align all of our activities around our blue ocean strategy What do we do when our blue ocean has become red How can we avoid the strong gravitational pulls of red ocean thinkingwe call them red ocean trapseven as were pursuing a blue ocean strategy These are the very questions that have motivated this expanded edition In this new preface we first outline whats new here We then briefly summarize the key points that define and distinguish blue ocean strategy and address why we believe blue ocean strategy is more needed and relevant than ever before Whats New in This Expanded Edition This edition adds two new chapters and expands a third Here are the highlights that show the gist of managers key challenges and trouble spots and how we address them Alignment What it means why its essential and how to achieve it A challenge we have been told about and have seen organizations struggle with is how they can align their system of activitiesincluding a potential web of external partnersto create a sustainable blue ocean strategy in practice Is there a simple yet comprehensive method to ensure that the key components of an organization from value to profit to people are aligned to support the strategic shift blue ocean strategy requires This is important as companies all too often focus on certain dimensions of their organizations paying less heed to other dimensions that must support the strategy to make it a sustainable success In recognition this expanded edition expressly explores the issue of alignment in the context of blue oceans We present cases of success and failure in alignment to show not only how it is achieved in action but also how it can be missed Chapter 9 addresses this alignment challenge Renewal When and how to renew blue oceans over time All companies rise and fall based on the strategic moves they make or dont make A challenge organizations face is how to renew blue oceans over time as every blue ocean will eventually be imitated and turn red Understanding the process of renewal is key to ensure that the creation of blue oceans is not a oneoff occurrence but can be institutionalized as a repeatable process in an organization In this expanded edition we tackle how leaders can turn the creation of blue oceans from a static achievement into a dynamic renewal process both at the business level and at the corporate level for multibusiness firms Here we articulate the dynamic renewal process for creating sustainable economic performance both for a single business that has reached for a blue ocean and for a multibusiness organization that has to balance both red and blue ocean initiatives In so doing we also highlight the complementary roles that red and blue ocean strategies play in managing a companys profit for today while building strong growth and brand value for tomorrow Chapter 10 addresses this renewal challenge Red Ocean Traps What they are and why they should be avoided Lastly we show the ten mostcommon red ocean traps we see companies fall into as they put blue ocean strategy into practice These traps keep companies anchored in the red even as they attempt to set sail for the blue Addressing these traps is critical to getting peoples framing right to create blue oceans With the proper grasp of the concept one can avoid the traps and apply its associated tools and methodologies with accuracy so that right strategic actions can be produced to sail toward clear blue waters Chapter 11 addresses the challenge of red ocean traps What Are the Main Points of Distinction The aim of blue ocean strategy was straightforward to allow any organizationlarge or small new or incumbentto step up to the challenge of creating blue oceans in an opportunitymaximizing risk minimizing way The book challenges several longheld beliefs in the field of strategy If we had to zoom in on five key points of distinction that make the book worthy of consideration it would be these Competition should not occupy the center of strategic thinking Too many companies let competition drive their strategies What blue ocean strategy brings to life however is that this focus on the competition all too often keeps companies anchored in the red ocean It puts the competition not the customer at the core of strategy As a result companies time and attention get focused on benchmarking rivals and responding to their strategic moves rather than on understanding how to deliver a leap in value to buyerswhich is not the same thing Blue ocean strategy breaks from the stranglehold of competition At the books core is the notion of a shift from competing to creating new market space and hence making the competition irrelevant We first made this point all the way back in 1997 in Value Innovation the first of our series of Harvard Business Review articles that form the basis of this book2 We observed that companies that break away from the competition pay little heed to matching or beating rivals or carving out a favorable competitive position Their aim was not to outperform competitors It was to offer a quantum leap in value that made the competition irrelevant The focus on innovating at value not positioning against competitors drives companies to challenge all the factors an industry competes on and to not assume that just because the competition is doing something means it is connected to buyer value In this way blue ocean strategy makes sense of the strategic paradox many organizations face the more they focus on coping with the competition and striving to match and beat their advantages the more they ironically tend to look like the competition To which blue ocean strategy would respond stop looking to the competition Valueinnovate and let the competition worry about you Industry structure is not given it can be shaped The field of strategy has long assumed that industry structure is given With industry structure seen as fixed firms are driven to build their strategies based on it And so strategy as is commonly practiced tees off with industry analysisthink five forces or its distant precursor SWOT analysiswhere strategy is about matching a companys strengths and weaknesses to the opportunities and threats present in the existing industry Here strategy perforce becomes a zerosum game where one companys gain is another companys loss as firms are bound by existing market space Blue ocean strategy by contrast shows how strategy can shape structure in an organizations favor to create new market space It is based on the view that market boundaries and industry structure are not given and can be reconstructed by the actions and beliefs of industry players As industry history shows new market spaces are being created every day and are fluid with imagination Buyers prove that as they trade across alternative industries refusing to see or be constrained by the cognitive boundaries industries impose upon themselves And firms prove that as they invent and reinvent industries collapsing altering and going beyond existing market boundaries to create all new demand In this way strategy moves from a zerosum to a nonzerosum game and even an unattractive industry can be made attractive by companies conscious efforts Which is to say a red ocean need not stay red This brings us to a third point of distinction Strategic creativity can be unlocked systematically Ever since Schumpeters vision of the lone and creative entrepreneur innovation and creativity have been essentially viewed as a black box unknowable and random3 Not surprisingly with innovation and creativity viewed as such the field of strategy predominantly focused on how to compete in established markets creating an arsenal of analytic tools and frameworks to skillfully achieve this But is creativity a black box When it comes to artistic creativity or scientific breakthroughsthink Gaudis majestic art or Marie Curies radium discoverythe answer may be yes But is the same true for strategic creativity that drives value innovation that opens up new market spaces Think Fords Model T in autos Starbucks in coffee or Salesforcecom in CRM software Our research suggests no It revealed common strategic patterns behind the successful creation of blue oceans These patterns allowed us to develop underlying analytic frameworks tools and methodologies to systematically link innovation to value and reconstruct industry boundaries in an opportunitymaximizing risk minimizing way While luck of course will always play a role as it does with all strategies these toolslike the strategy canvas four actions framework and six paths to reconstruct market boundariesbring structure to what has historically been an unstructured problem in strategy informing organizations ability to create blue oceans systematically Execution can be built into strategy formulation Blue ocean strategy is a strategy that joins analytics with the human dimension of organizations It recognizes and pays respect to the importance of aligning peoples minds and hearts with a new strategy so that at the level of the individual people embrace it of their own accord and willingly go beyond compulsory execution to voluntary cooperation in carrying it out To achieve this blue ocean strategy does not separate strategy formulation from execution Although this disconnect may be a hallmark of most companies practices our research shows it is also a hallmark of slow and questionable implementation and mechanical followthrough at best Instead blue ocean strategy builds execution into strategy from the start through the practice of fair process in the making and rolling out of strategy Over twentyfive years we have written about the impact of fair process on the quality of execution of decisions through many academic and managerial publications4 As blue ocean strategy brings to light fair process prepares the ground for implementation by invoking the most fundamental basis of action trust commitment and the voluntary cooperation of people deep in an organization Commitment trust and voluntary cooperation are not merely attitudes or behaviors They are intangible capital They allow companies to stand apart in the speed quality and consistency of their execution and to implement strategic shifts fast at low cost A stepbystep model for creating strategy The field of strategy has produced a wealth of knowledge on the content of strategy However what it has remained virtually silent on is the key question of how to create a strategy to begin with Of course we know how to produce plans But as we all know the planning process doesnt produce strategy In short we dont have a theory of strategy creation While there are many theories that explain why companies fail and succeed they are mostly descriptive not prescriptive There is no stepby step model that prescribes in specific terms how companies can formulate and execute their strategies to obtain high performance Such a model is introduced here in the context of blue oceans to show how companies can avoid marketcompeting traps and achieve marketcreating innovations The strategymaking framework we advance here is built based on our strategy practices in the field with many companies over the last two decades It helps managers in action as they formulate strategies that are innovative and wealth creating Why Is Blue Ocean Strategy of Rising Importance When we first published Blue Ocean Strategy in 2005 there were many forces driving the importance of creating blue oceans At the top of the list was the fact that competition in existing industries was getting fiercer and pressure on costs and profits was increasing These forces have not gone away On the contrary theyve only intensified But beyond these over the last ten years several new global trends have kicked in with a speed few could have ever imagined when our book first came out We believe that these trends make creating blue oceans an even more important strategic task in the future Here we highlight some of them without intending to be comprehensive in their coverage or content A rising call for creative new solutions Just look at a broad swath of industries that matter fundamentally to who we are health care K12 education universities financial services energy the environment and the government where demands are high yet money and budgets are low In the last ten years every one of these industries has been seriously called to task There has hardly been a time in history when the strategies of players in so many industries and sectors needed fundamental rethinking To remain relevant all these players are increasingly being called on to reimagine their strategies to achieve innovative value at lower costs The rising influence and use of public megaphones Its hard to believe but only ten years back organizations still controlled the majority of information disseminated to the public on their products services and offerings Today thats history The surge in social network sites blogs microblogs videosharing services userdriven content and internet ratings that have become close to ubiquitous around the globe have shifted the power and credibility of voice from organizations to individuals To not be a victim but a victor in this new reality your offering needs to stand out as never before Thats what gets people tweeting your praises not your faults giving fivestar ratings clicking the thumbs up not the thumbs down listing your offering as a favorite on social media sites and even being inspired to positively blog about your offering You cant hide or overmarket your metoo offering when virtually everyone has a global megaphone A locational shift in future demand and growth When people around the world talk about the growth markets of the future Europe and Japan hardly get a mention these days Even the United States though still the largest economy in the world has increasingly taken a backseat in terms of future growth prospects Instead today China and India not to mention countries like Brazil top the list In the space of the last ten years all three have joined the ranks of the topten largest economies However this new breed of big economies is not like the large economies the world has historically looked to and counted on to consume the goods and services produced by the world Unlike the relatively high per capita incomes enjoyed in the worlds developed economies these big emerging markets are the product of very low though rising per capita income for very large populations of citizens This makes the importance of affordable low cost in organizations offerings more critical than before But do not be fooled Low cost alone is not enough For these same large populations also have increasing access to the internet mobile phones and TVs with global channels that raise their sophistication demands and desires To capture these increasingly savvy customers imaginations and wallets both differentiation and low cost are needed The rising speed and easiness of becoming a global player Historically the major global companies came predominantly from the United States Europe and Japan But that is changing at incredible speed Over the last fifteen years the number of companies from China in the Fortune Global 500 has increased more than twenty times the number of Indian companies has increased roughly eightfold and the number of Latin American companies more than doubled This suggests that these big emerging economies do not only represent oceans of new demand to unlock They also represent oceans of new potential competitors with global ambitions no different than Toyotas General Electrics or Unilevers But its not just companies from these big emerging markets that are on the rise That is just a tip of the iceberg of what the future portends In the last decade there has been a fundamental shift in the cost and ease of becoming a global player from virtually any corner of the globe This is a trend no organization can afford to downplay Consider just a handful of facts With the ease and low cost of setting up a website any business can have a global storefront today people from anywhere can raise money via crowdfunding with services like Gmail and Skype communication costs have dropped significantly trust in transactions can now be rapidly and economically achieved by using services like PayPal while companies like Alibabacom make searching for and vetting suppliers across the world relatively quick and easy And there are search enginesthe equivalent of global business directoriesthat are free As for global advertising there is Twitter and YouTube where you can market your offerings for free With the low entry cost to become a global player new players from virtually all corners of the world can increasingly participate in global markets and offer their wares or services While of course these trends dont mitigate all barriers to becoming a global player they certainly intensify global competition To stand apart in these overcrowded markets you need to be creative through value innovation Today both the challenges and opportunities we all face are great By providing methodologies and tools organizations can apply to pursue blue oceans it is our hope that these ideas will help to meet these challenges and create opportunities so we all come out better Strategy after all is not just for business It is for everyonethe arts nonprofits the public sector even countries We invite you to join us on this journey One thing is clear the world needs blue oceans Preface to the Original Edition THIS IS A BOOK about friendship about loyalty about believing in one another It was because of that friendship and that belief that we set out on the journey to explore the ideas in this book and eventually came to write it We met twenty years ago in a classroomone the professor the other the student And we have worked together ever since often seeing ourselves along the journey as two wet rats in a drain This book is not the victory of an idea but of a friendship that we have found more meaningful than any idea in the world of business It has made our lives rich and our worlds more beautiful We were not alone No journey is easy no friendship is filled only with laughter But we were excited every day of that journey because we were on a mission to learn and improve We believe passionately in the ideas in this book These ideas are not for those whose ambition in life is to get by or merely to survive That was never an interest of ours If you can be satisfied with that do not read on But if you want to make a difference to create a company that builds a future where customers employees shareholders and society win read on We are not saying it is easy but it is worthwhile Our research confirms that there are no permanently excellent companies just as there are no permanently excellent industries As we have found on our own tumbling road we all like corporations do smart things and lessthansmart things To improve the quality of our success we need to study what we did that made a positive difference and understand how to replicate it systematically That is what we call making smart strategic moves and we have found that the strategic move that matters centrally is to create blue oceans Blue ocean strategy challenges companies to break out of the red ocean of bloody competition by creating uncontested market space that makes the competition irrelevant Instead of dividing up existingand often shrinking demand and benchmarking competitors blue ocean strategy is about growing demand and breaking away from the competition This book not only challenges companies but also shows them how to achieve this We first introduce a set of analytical tools and frameworks that show you how to systematically act on this challenge and second we elaborate the principles that define and separate blue ocean strategy from competition based strategic thought Our aim is to make the formulation and execution of blue ocean strategy as systematic and actionable as competing in the red waters of known market space Only then can companies step up to the challenge of creating blue oceans in a smart and responsible way that is both opportunity maximizing and risk minimizing No companylarge or small incumbent or new entrantcan afford to be a riverboat gambler And no company should The contents of this book are based on more than fifteen years of research data stretching back more than a hundred years and a series of Harvard Business Review articles as well as academic articles on various dimensions of this topic The ideas tools and frameworks presented here have been further tested and refined over the years in corporate practice in Europe the United States and Asia This book builds on and extends this work by providing a narrative arc that draws these ideas together to offer a unified framework This framework addresses not only the analytic aspects behind the creation of blue ocean strategy but also the allimportant human aspects of how to bring an organization and its people on this journey with a willingness to execute these ideas in action Here understanding how to build trust and commitment as well as an understanding of the importance of intellectual and emotional recognition are highlighted and brought to the core of strategy Blue ocean opportunities have been out there As they have been explored the market universe has been expanding This expansion we believe is the root of growth Yet poor understanding exists both in theory and in practice as to how to systematically create and capture blue oceans We invite you to read this book to learn how you can be a driver of this expansion in the future Acknowledgments WE HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT help in actualizing this book INSEAD has provided a unique environment in which to conduct our research We have benefited greatly from the crossover

ONE Blue Ocean Strategy CHAPTER 1 Creating Blue Oceans A ONETIME ACCORDION PLAYER stilt walker and fire eater Guy Lalibert is now CEO of Cirque du Soleil one of Canadas largest cultural exports Cirques productions to date have been seen by some 150 million people in over three hundred cities around the world In less than twenty years since its creation Cirque du Soleil achieved a level of revenues that took Ringling Bros and Barnum Baileythe once global champion of the circus industrymore than one hundred years to attain What makes this growth all the more remarkable is that it was not achieved in an attractive industry but rather in a declining industry in which traditional strategic analysis pointed to limited potential for growth Supplier power on the part of star performers was strong So was buyer power Alternative forms of entertainmentranging from various kinds of urban live entertainment to sporting events to home entertainmentcast an increasingly long shadow Children cried out for video games rather than a visit to the traveling circus Partially as a result the industry was suffering from steadily decreasing audiences and in turn declining revenue and profits There was also increasing sentiment against the use of animals in circuses by animal rights groups Ringling Bros and Barnum Bailey had long set the standard and competing smaller circuses essentially followed with scaleddown versions From the perspective of competitionbased strategy then the circus industry appeared unattractive Another compelling aspect of Cirque du Soleils success is that it did not win by taking customers from the already shrinking circus industry which historically catered to children Cirque du Soleil did not compete with Ringling Bros and Barnum Bailey Instead it created uncontested new market space that made the competition irrelevant It appealed to a whole new group of customers adults and corporate clients prepared to pay a price several times as great as traditional circuses for an unprecedented entertainment experience Significantly one of the first Cirque productions was titled We Reinvent the Circus New Market Space Cirque du Soleil succeeded because it realized that to win in the future companies must stop competing with each other The only way to beat the competition is to stop trying to beat the competition To understand what Cirque du Soleil achieved imagine a market universe composed of two sorts of oceans red oceans and blue oceans Red oceans represent all the industries in existence today This is the known market space Blue oceans denote all the industries not in existence today This is the unknown market space In the red oceans industry boundaries are defined and accepted and the competitive rules of the game are known1 Here companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of existing demand As the market space gets crowded prospects for profits and growth are reduced Products become commodities and cutthroat competition turns the red ocean bloody Blue oceans in contrast are defined by untapped market space demand creation and the opportunity for highly profitable growth Although some blue oceans are created well beyond existing industry boundaries most are created from within red oceans by expanding existing industry boundaries as Cirque du Soleil did In blue oceans competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be set It will always be important to swim successfully in the red ocean by outcompeting rivals Red oceans will always matter and will always be a fact of business life But with supply exceeding demand in more industries competing for a share of contracting markets while necessary will not be sufficient to sustain high performance2 Companies need to go beyond competing To seize new profit and growth opportunities they also need to create blue oceans Unfortunately blue oceans are largely uncharted The dominant focus of strategy work over the past thirty years has been on competitionbased red ocean strategies3 The result has been a fairly good understanding of how to compete skillfully in red waters from analyzing the underlying economic structure of an existing industry to choosing a strategic position of low cost or differentiation or focus to benchmarking the competition Some discussions around blue oceans exist4 However there is little practical guidance on how to create them Without analytic frameworks to create blue oceans and principles to effectively manage risk creating blue oceans has remained wishful thinking that is seen as too risky for managers to pursue as strategy This book provides practical frameworks and analytics for the systematic pursuit and capture of blue oceans The Continuing Creation of Blue Oceans Although the term blue oceans is new their existence is not They are a feature of business life past and present Look back 120 years and ask yourself How many of todays industries were then unknown The answer many industries as basic as automobiles music recording aviation petrochemicals health care and management consulting were unheard of or had just begun to emerge at that time Now turn the clock back only forty years Again a plethora of multibillionand trilliondollar industries jumps outecommerce cell phones laptops routers switches and networking devices gasfired electricity plants biotechnology discount retail express package delivery minivans snowboards and coffee bars to name a few Just four decades ago none of these industries existed in a meaningful way Now put the clock forward twenty yearsor perhaps fifty yearsand ask yourself how many now unknown industries will likely exist then If history is any predictor of the future again the answer is many of them The reality is that industries never stand still They continuously evolve Operations improve markets expand and players come and go History teaches us that we have a hugely underestimated capacity to create new industries and recreate existing ones In fact the more than halfcentury old Standard Industrial Classification SIC system published by the US Census was replaced in 1997 by the North America Industry Classification Standard NAICS system The new system expanded the ten SIC industry sectors into twenty sectors to reflect the emerging realities of new industry territories5 The services sector under the old system for example is now expanded into seven business sectors ranging from information to health care and social assistance6 Given that these systems are designed for standardization and continuity such a replacement shows how significant the expansion of blue oceans has been Yet the overriding focus of strategic thinking has been on competition based red ocean strategies Part of the explanation for this is that corporate strategy is heavily influenced by its roots in military strategy The very language of strategy is deeply imbued with military referenceschief executive officers in headquarters troops on the front lines Described this way strategy is about confronting an opponent and fighting over a given piece of land that is both limited and constant7 Unlike war however the history of industry shows us that the market universe has never been constant rather blue oceans have continuously been created over time To focus on the red ocean is therefore to accept the key constraining factors of warlimited terrain and the need to beat an enemy to succeedand to deny the distinctive strength of the business world the capacity to create new market space that is uncontested The Impact of Creating Blue Oceans We set out to quantify the impact of creating blue oceans on a companys growth in both revenues and profits in a study of the business launches of 108 companies see figure 11 We found that 86 percent of the launches were line extensions that is incremental improvements within the red ocean of existing market space Yet they accounted for only 62 percent of total revenues and a mere 39 percent of total profits The remaining 14 percent of the launches were aimed at creating blue oceans They generated 38 percent of total revenues and 61 percent of total profits Given that business launches included the total investments made for creating red and blue oceans regardless of their subsequent revenue and profit consequences including failures the performance benefits of creating blue waters are evident Although we dont have data on the hit rate of success of red and blue ocean initiatives the global performance differences between them are marked FIGURE 11 The profit and growth consequences of creating blue oceans The Rising Imperative of Creating Blue Oceans There are several driving forces behind a rising imperative to create blue oceans Accelerated technological advances have substantially improved industrial productivity and have allowed suppliers to produce an unprecedented array of products and services The result is that in increasing numbers of industries supply exceeds demand8 The trend toward globalization compounds the situation As trade barriers between nations and regions are dismantled and as information on products and prices becomes instantly and globally available niche markets and havens for monopoly continue to disappear9 While supply is on the rise as global competition intensifies there is no clear evidence of an increase in demand relative to supply and statistics even point to declining populations in many developed markets10 The result has been accelerated commoditization of products and services increasing price wars and shrinking profit margins Industrywide studies on major American brands confirm this trend11 They reveal that for major product and service categories brands are generally becoming more similar and as they are becoming more similar people increasingly select based on price12 People no longer insist as in the past that their laundry detergent be Tide Nor will they necessarily stick to Colgate when Crest is on sale and vice versa In overcrowded industries differentiating brands becomes harder in both economic upturns and downturns All this suggests that the business environment in which most strategy and management approaches of the twentieth century evolved is increasingly disappearing As red oceans become increasingly bloody management will need to be more concerned with blue oceans than the current cohort of managers is accustomed to From Company and Industry to Strategic Move How can a company break out of the red ocean of bloody competition How can it create a blue ocean Is there a systematic approach to achieve this and thereby sustain high performance In search of an answer our initial step was to define the basic unit of analysis for our research To understand the roots of high performance the business literature typically uses the company as the basic unit of analysis People have marveled at how companies attain strong profitable growth with a distinguished set of strategic operational and organizational characteristics Our question however was this Are there lasting excellent or visionary companies that continuously outperform the market and repeatedly create blue oceans Consider for example In Search of Excellence and Built to Last13 The bestselling book In Search of Excellence was published some thirty years ago Yet within two years of its publication a number of the companies surveyed began to slip into oblivion Atari ChesebroughPonds Data General Fluor National Semiconductor As documented in Managing on the Edge twothirds of the identified model firms in the book had fallen from their perches as industry leaders within five years of its publication14 The book Built to Last continued in the same footsteps It sought out the successful habits of visionary companies that had a longrunning track record of superior performance To avoid the pitfalls of In Search of Excellence however the survey period of Built to Last was expanded to the entire life span of the companies while its analysis was limited to firms more than forty years old Built to Last also became a bestseller But again upon closer examination deficiencies in some of the visionary companies spotlighted in Built to Last have come to light As illustrated in the book Creative Destruction much of the success attributed to some of the model companies in Built to Last was the result of industrysector performance rather than the companies themselves15 For example HewlettPackard HP met the criteria of Built to Last by outperforming the market over the long term In reality while HP outperformed the market so did the entire computerhardware industry Whats more HP did not even outperform the competition within the industry Through this and other examples Creative Destruction questioned whether visionary companies that continuously outperform the market have ever existed If there is no perpetually highperforming company and if the same company can be brilliant at one moment and wrongheaded at another it appears that the company is not the appropriate unit of analysis in exploring the roots of high performance and blue oceans As discussed earlier history also shows that industries are constantly being created and expanded over time and that industry conditions and boundaries are not given individual actors can shape them Companies need not compete headon in a given industry space Cirque du Soleil created a new market space in the entertainment sector generating strong profitable growth as a result It appears then that neither the company nor the industry is the best unit of analysis in studying the roots of profitable growth Consistent with this observation our study shows that the strategic move and not the company or the industry is the right unit of analysis for explaining the creation of blue oceans and sustained high performance A strategic move is the set of managerial actions and decisions involved in making a major marketcreating business offering Compaq for example was acquired by HewlettPackard in 2001 and ceased to be an independent company As a result many people might judge the company as unsuccessful This does not however invalidate the blue ocean strategic moves that Compaq made in creating the server industry These strategic moves not only were a part of the companys powerful comeback in the mid1990s but also unlocked a new multibilliondollar market space in computing Appendix A A Sketch of the Historical Pattern of Blue Ocean Creation provides a snapshot overview of the history of three representative US industries drawn from our database the auto industry how we get to work the computer industrywhat we use at work and the cinema industrywhere we go after work for enjoyment As shown in appendix A no perpetually excellent company or industry is found But a striking commonality appears to exist across strategic moves that have created blue oceans and have led to new trajectories of strong profitable growth The strategic moves we discussmoves that have delivered products and services that opened and captured new market space with a significant leap in demandcontain great stories of profitable growth as well as thought provoking tales of missed opportunities by companies stuck in red oceans We built our study around these strategic moves to understand the pattern by which blue oceans are created and high performance achieved The original research for our book covered more than one hundred fifty strategic moves made from 1880 to 2000 in more than thirty industries In conducting our research we closely examined the relevant business players in each event Industries ranged from hotels the cinema retail airlines energy computers broadcasting and construction to automobiles and steel We analyzed not only winning business players who created blue oceans but also their less successful competitors Both within a given strategic move and across strategic moves we searched for convergence among the group that created blue oceans and within less successful players caught in the red ocean We also searched for divergence across these two groups In so doing we tried to discover the common factors leading to the creation of blue oceans and the key differences separating those winners from the mere survivors and the losers adrift in the red ocean Our analysis of more than thirty industries confirms that neither industry nor organizational characteristics explain the distinction between the two groups In assessing industry organizational and strategic variables we found that the creation and capturing of blue oceans were achieved by small and large companies by young and old managers by companies in attractive and unattractive industries by new entrants and established incumbents by private and public companies by companies in B2B and B2C industries and by companies of diverse national origins Our analysis failed to find any perpetually excellent company or industry What we did find behind the seemingly idiosyncratic success stories however was a consistent and common pattern across strategic moves for creating and capturing blue oceans Whether it was Ford in 1908 with the Model T GM in 1924 with cars styled to appeal to the emotions CNN in 1980 with realtime news 247 or Compaq Servers Starbucks Southwest Airlines Cirque du Soleil or more recently Salesforcecomor for that matter any of the other blue ocean moves in our studythe approach to strategy in creating blue oceans was consistent across time regardless of industry Our research also reached out to embrace famous strategic moves in publicsector turnarounds Here we found a strikingly similar pattern As our database and research have continued to expand and grow over the last ten years since the first edition of our book was published we have continued to observe similar patterns Value Innovation The Cornerstone of Blue Ocean Strategy What consistently separated winners from losers in creating blue oceans was their approach to strategy The companies caught in the red ocean followed a conventional approach racing to beat the competition by building a defensible position within the existing industry order16 The creators of blue oceans surprisingly didnt use the competition as their benchmark17 Instead they followed a different strategic logic that we call value innovation Value innovation is the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy We call it value innovation because instead of focusing on beating the competition you focus on making the competition irrelevant by creating a leap in value for buyers and your company thereby opening up new and uncontested market space Value innovation places equal emphasis on value and innovation Value without innovation tends to focus on value creation on an incremental scale something that improves value but is not sufficient to make you stand out in the marketplace18 Innovation without value tends to be technologydriven market pioneering or futuristic often shooting beyond what buyers are ready to accept and pay for19 In this sense it is important to distinguish between value innovation as opposed to technology innovation and market pioneering Our study shows that what separates winners from losers in creating blue oceans is neither bleedingedge technology nor timing for market entry Sometimes these exist more often however they do not Value innovation occurs only when companies align innovation with utility price and cost positions If they fail to anchor innovation with value in this way technology innovators and market pioneers often lay the eggs that other companies hatch Value innovation is a new way of thinking about and executing strategy that results in the creation of a blue ocean and a break from the competition Importantly value innovation defies one of the most commonly accepted dogmas of competitionbased strategy the valuecost tradeoff20 It is conventionally believed that companies can either create greater value to customers at a higher cost or create reasonable value at a lower cost Here strategy is seen as making a choice between differentiation and low cost21 In contrast those that seek to create blue oceans pursue differentiation and low cost simultaneously Lets return to the example of Cirque du Soleil Pursuing differentiation and low cost simultaneously lies at the heart of the entertainment experience it created At the time of its debut other circuses focused on benchmarking one another and maximizing their share of already shrinking demand by tweaking traditional circus acts This included trying to secure more famous clowns and lion tamers a strategy that raised circuses cost structure without substantially altering the circus experience The result was rising costs without rising revenues and a downward spiral of overall circus demand These efforts were made irrelevant when Cirque du Soleil appeared Neither an ordinary circus nor a classic theater production Cirque du Soleil paid no heed to what the competition did Instead of following the conventional logic of outpacing the competition by offering a better solution to the given problemcreating a circus with even greater fun and thrillsit sought to offer people the fun and thrill of the circus and the intellectual sophistication and artistic richness of the theater at the same time hence it redefined the problem itself22 By breaking the market boundaries of theater and circus Cirque du Soleil gained a new understanding not only of circus customers but also of circus noncustomers adult theater customers This led to a whole new circus concept that broke the valuecost tradeoff and created a blue ocean of new market space Consider the differences Whereas other circuses focused on offering animal shows hiring star performers presenting multiple show arenas in the form of three rings and pushing aisle concession sales Cirque du Soleil did away with all these factors These factors had long been taken for granted in the traditional circus industry which never questioned their ongoing relevance However there was increasing public discomfort with the use of animals Moreover animal acts were one of the most expensive elements including not only the cost of the animals but also their training medical care housing insurance and transportation Similarly while the circus industry focused on featuring stars in the mind of the public the socalled stars of the circus were trivial next to movie stars or famous singers Again they were a highcost component carrying little sway with spectators Gone too are threering venues Not only did this arrangement create angst among spectators as they rapidly switched their gaze from one ring to the other but it also increased the number of performers needed with obvious cost implications And although aisle concession sales appeared to be a good way to generate revenue in practice the high prices discouraged audiences from making purchases and made them feel they were being taken for a ride The lasting allure of the traditional circus came down to only three key factors the tent the clowns and the classic acrobatic acts such as the wheelman and short stunts So Cirque du Soleil kept the clowns but shifted their humor from slapstick to a more enchanting sophisticated style It glamorized the tent an element that ironically many circuses had begun to forfeit in favor of rented venues Seeing that this unique venue symbolically captured the magic of the circus Cirque du Soleil designed the classic symbol of the circus with a glorious external finish and a higher level of comfort making its tents reminiscent of the grand epic circuses Gone were the sawdust and hard benches Acrobats and other thrilling acts are retained but their roles were reduced and made more elegant by the addition of artistic flair and intellectual wonder to the acts By looking across the market boundary of theater Cirque du Soleil also offered new noncircus factors such as a story line and with it intellectual richness artistic music and dance and multiple productions These factors entirely new creations for the circus industry are drawn from the alternative live entertainment industry of theater Unlike traditional circus shows having a series of unrelated acts for example Cirque du Soleil creations have a theme and story line somewhat resembling a theater performance Although the theme is vague and intentionally so it brings harmony and an intellectual element to the show without limiting the potential for acts Cirque also borrows ideas from Broadway shows For example it features multiple productions rather than the traditional one for all shows As with Broadway shows too each Cirque du Soleil show has an original score and assorted music which drives the visual performance lighting and timing of the acts rather than the other way around The shows feature abstract and spiritual dance an idea derived from theater and ballet By introducing these new factors into its offering Cirque du Soleil has created more sophisticated shows Moreover by injecting the concept of multiple productions and by giving people a reason to come to the circus more frequently Cirque du Soleil dramatically increased demand In short Cirque du Soleil offers the best of both circus and theater and it has eliminated or reduced everything else By offering unprecedented utility Cirque du Soleil created a blue ocean and invented a new form of live entertainment one that is markedly different from both traditional circus and theater At the same time by eliminating many of the most costly elements of the circus it dramatically reduced its cost structure achieving both differentiation and low cost Cirque strategically priced its tickets against those of the theater lifting the price point of the circus industry by several multiples while still pricing its productions to capture the mass of adult customers who were used to theater prices Figure 12 depicts the differentiation low cost dynamics underpinning value innovation FIGURE 12 Value innovation The cornerstone of blue ocean strategy Value innovation is created in the region where a companys actions favorably affect both its cost structure and its value proposition to buyers Cost savings are made by eliminating and reducing the factors an industry competes on Buyer value is lifted by raising and creating elements the industry has never offered Over time costs are reduced further as scale economies kick in due to the high sales volumes that superior value generates As shown in figure 12 the creation of blue oceans is about driving costs down while simultaneously driving value up for buyers This is how a leap in value for both the company and its buyers is achieved Because buyer value comes from the utility and price that the company offers to buyers and because the value to the company is generated from price and its cost structure value innovation is achieved only when the system of the companys utility price and cost activities is properly aligned To sustain value innovation however people working for and with the company need to support it For value innovation to be a sustainable strategy then the alignment of the companys utility price cost and people is needed It is this wholesystem approach that makes value innovation strategic rather than operational or functional In contrast innovations such as production innovations can be achieved at the subsystem level without impacting the companys overall strategy An innovation in the production process for example may lower a companys cost structure to reinforce its existing cost leadership strategy without changing the utility proposition of its offering Although innovations of this sort may help to secure and even lift a companys position in the existing market space such a subsystem approach will rarely create a blue ocean of new market space In this sense value innovation is a distinct concept It is about strategy that embraces the entire system of a companys activities23 Value innovation requires companies to orient the whole system toward achieving a leap in value for both buyers and themselves Absent such an integral approach innovation will remain divided from the core of strategy24 Figure 13 outlines the key defining features of red and blue ocean strategies FIGURE 13 Red ocean versus blue ocean strategy Competitionbased red ocean strategy assumes that an industrys structural conditions are given and that firms are forced to compete within them an assumption based on what the academics call the structuralist view or environmental determinism25 In contrast value innovation is based on the view that market boundaries and industry structure are not given and can be reconstructed by the actions and beliefs of industry players We call this the reconstructionist view In the red ocean differentiation raises costs because firms compete with the same bestpractice rule Here the strategic choices for firms are to pursue either differentiation or low cost In the reconstructionist world however the strategic aim is to create new best practice rules by breaking the existing valuecost tradeoff and thereby creating a blue ocean For more discussions on this see appendix B Value Innovation A Reconstructionist View of Strategy Cirque du Soleil broke the best practice rule of the circus industry achieving both differentiation and low cost by reconstructing elements across existing industry boundaries Is Cirque du Soleil then really a circus with all that it eliminated reduced raised and created Or is it theater And if it is theater then what genrea Broadway show an opera a ballet It is not clear Cirque du Soleil reconstructed elements across these alternatives and in the end it is simultaneously a little of all of them and none of any of them in their entirety It created a blue ocean of new uncontested market space Formulating and Executing Blue Ocean Strategy Although economic conditions indicate the rising imperative of blue oceans there is a general belief that the odds of success are lower when companies venture beyond existing industry space26 The issue is how to succeed in blue oceans How can companies systematically maximize the opportunities while simultaneously minimizing the risks of formulating and executing blue ocean strategy If you lack an understanding of the opportunitymaximizing and riskminimizing principles driving the creation and capture of blue oceans the odds will be lengthened against your blue ocean initiative Of course there is no such thing as a riskless strategy27 Strategy will always involve both opportunity and risk be it a red ocean or a blue ocean initiative But at present the playing field is dramatically unbalanced in favor of tools and analytical frameworks to succeed in red oceans As long as this remains true red oceans will continue to dominate companies strategic agendas even as the business imperative for creating blue oceans takes on new urgency Perhaps this explains why despite prior calls for companies to go beyond existing industry space companies have yet to act seriously on these recommendations This book seeks to address this imbalance by laying out a methodology to support our thesis Here we present the principles and analytical frameworks to succeed in blue oceans Chapter 2 introduces the analytical tools and frameworks that are essential for creating and capturing blue oceans Although supplementary tools are introduced in other chapters as needed these basic analytics are used throughout the book Companies can make proactive changes in industry or market fundamentals through the purposeful application of these blue ocean tools and frameworks which are grounded in the issues of both opportunity and risk Subsequent chapters introduce the principles that drive the successful formulation and implementation of blue ocean strategy and explain how they along with the analytics are applied in action There are four guiding principles for the successful formulation of blue ocean strategy Chapters 3 through 6 address these in turn Chapter 3 identifies the paths by which you can systematically create uncontested market space across diverse industry domains hence attenuating search risk It teaches you how to make the competition irrelevant by looking across the six conventional boundaries of competition to open up commercially important blue oceans The six paths focus on looking across alternative industries across strategic groups across buyer groups across complementary product and service offerings across the functionalemotional orientation of an industry and even across time Chapter 4 shows how to design a companys strategic planning process to go beyond incremental improvements to create value innovations It presents an alternative to the existing strategic planning process which is often criticized as a numbercrunching exercise that keeps companies locked into making incremental improvements This principle tackles planning risk Using a visualizing approach that drives you to focus on the big picture rather than to be submerged in numbers and jargon this chapter proposes a fourstep process whereby you can build a strategy that creates and captures blue ocean opportunities Chapter 5 shows how to maximize the size of a blue ocean To create the greatest market of new demand this chapter challenges the conventional practice of aiming for finer segmentation to better meet existing customer preferences This practice often results in increasingly small target markets Instead this chapter shows you how to aggregate demand not by focusing on the differences that separate customers but by building on the powerful commonalities across noncustomers to maximize the size of the blue ocean being created and new demand being unlocked hence minimizing scale risk Chapter 6 lays out the design of a strategy that allows you not only to provide a leap in value to the mass of buyers but also to build a viable business model to produce and maintain profitable growth It shows you how to ensure that your company builds a business model that profits from the blue ocean it is creating It addresses business model risk The chapter articulates the sequence in which you should create a strategy to ensure that both you and your customers win as you create new business terrain Such a strategy follows the sequence of utility price cost and adoption Chapters 7 through 10 turn to the principles that drive effective execution of blue ocean strategy Specifically chapter 7 introduces what we call tipping point leadership Tipping point leadership shows managers how to mobilize an organization to overcome the key organizational hurdles that block the implementation of a blue ocean strategy It deals with organizational risk It lays out how leaders and managers alike can surmount the cognitive resource motivational and political hurdles in spite of limited time and resources in executing blue ocean strategy Chapter 8 argues for the integration of execution into strategy making thus motivating people to act on and execute a blue ocean strategy in a sustained way deep in an organization This chapter introduces what we call fair process Because a blue ocean strategy perforce represents a departure from the status quo this chapter shows how fair process facilitates both strategy making and execution by mobilizing people for the voluntary cooperation needed to execute blue ocean strategy It deals with management risk associated with peoples attitudes and behaviors People here include both internal and external stakeholders who work for and with an organization Chapter 9 new in this expanded edition tackles the overarching concept of alignment and the critical role it plays for the sustainability of a strategy Here we provide a simple but comprehensive framework to fully develop and align an organizations three strategy propositions from value to profit to people It deals with how to manage sustainability risk While this chapter starts with the importance of alignment for the sustainability of any strategy whether blue or red it shows how alignment works in the context of blue ocean strategy by illustrating and contrasting cases of success and failure Chapter 10 addresses the issue of renewal and the dynamic aspects of blue ocean strategy at both the business level and the corporate level for multibusiness firms Here we expand our original discussion on how to manage and monitor your individual business and your corporate portfolio over time to achieve continuing high performance In so doing this chapter deals with the important issue of managing renewal risk so that the blue ocean strategy process can become institutionalized rather than a oneoff occurrence This chapter shows how red and blue ocean strategies fit together and complement each other in the context of managing a corporate portfolio over time Figure 14 highlights the eight principles driving the successful formulation and execution of blue ocean strategy and the risks that these principles attenuate FIGURE 14 The eight principles of blue ocean strategy Lastly we end our expanded edition with a new chapter where we zoom in on the ten mostcommon red ocean traps that keep organizations anchored in the red even as they set out to sail into the blue Here we expressly address how to avoid each of these traps We highlight and set straight the misconceptions behind these red ocean traps to ensure people have not only the right framing but also the proper application of blue ocean strategy tools to achieve success in practice Lets now move on to chapter 2 where we lay out the basic analytical tools and frameworks that will be used throughout this book in the formulation and execution of blue ocean strategy CHAPTER 2 Analytical Tools and Frameworks WE SPENT A DECADE DEVELOPING a set of analytical tools and frameworks in an attempt to make the formulation and execution of blue ocean strategy as systematic and actionable as competing in the red waters of known market space These analytics fill a central void in the field of strategy which has developed an impressive array of tools and frameworks to compete in red oceans such as the five forces for analyzing existing industry conditions and three generic strategies but has remained virtually silent on practical tools to excel in blue oceans Instead executives have received calls to be brave and entrepreneurial to learn from failure and to seek out revolutionaries Although thought provoking these are not substitutes for analytics to navigate successfully in blue waters In the absence of analytics executives cannot be expected to act on the call to break out of existing competition Effective blue ocean strategy should be about risk minimization and not risk taking To address this imbalance we studied companies around the world and developed practical methodologies in the quest of blue oceans We then applied and tested these tools and frameworks in action by working with companies in their pursuit of blue oceans enriching and refining them in the process The tools and frameworks presented here are used throughout this book as we discuss the eight principles of formulating and executing blue ocean strategy As a brief introduction to these tools and frameworks lets look at one industrythe US wine industryto see how these tools can be applied in practice in the creation of blue oceans Here is the situation Up until 2000 the United States had the third largest aggregate consumption of wine worldwide with an estimated 20 billion in sales Yet despite its size the industry was intensely competitive California wines dominated the domestic market capturing twothirds of all US wine sales These wines competed headtohead with imported wines from France Italy and Spain and New World wines from countries such as Chile Australia and Argentina which increasingly targeted the US market At the same time the supply of wines was increasing from Oregon Washington and New York State and with newly mature vineyard plantings in California the number of wines was exploding Yet the US consumer base had essentially remained stagnant The United States remained stuck at thirtyfirst place in world per capita wine consumption The intense competition fueled ongoing industry consolidation The top eight companies produced more than 75 percent of the wine in the United States and the estimated one thousand six hundred other wineries at the time produced the remaining 25 percent The dominance of a few key players allowed them to leverage distributors to gain shelf space and put millions of dollars into abovetheline marketing budgets A simultaneous consolidation of retailers and distributors was also underway across the United States something that raised their bargaining power against the plethora of wine makers Titanic battles were being fought for retail and distribution space It is no surprise that weak poorly run companies were increasingly being swept aside Downward pressure on wine prices had set in In short the US wine industry in 2000 faced intense competition mounting price pressure increasing bargaining power on the part of retail and distribution channels and flat demand despite overwhelming choice Following conventional strategic thinking the industry was hardly attractive For strategists the critical question is How do you break out of this red ocean of bloody competition to make the competition irrelevant How do you open up and capture a blue ocean of uncontested market space To address these questions we turn to the strategy canvas an analytic framework that is central to value innovation and the creation of blue oceans The Strategy Canvas The strategy canvas is both a diagnostic and an action framework for building a compelling blue ocean strategy It serves two purposes First it captures the current state of play in the known market space This allows you to understand where the competition is currently investing the factors the industry currently competes on in products service and delivery and what customers receive from the existing competitive offerings on the market Figure 21 captures all this information in graphic form The horizontal axis captures the range of factors the industry competes on and invests in FIGURE 21 The strategy canvas of the US wine industry in the late 1990s In the case of the US wine industry it had long competed on seven principal factors Price per bottle of wine An elite refined image in packaging including labels announcing the wine medals won and the use of esoteric enological terminology to stress the art and science of wine making Abovetheline marketing to raise consumer awareness in a crowded market and to encourage distributors and retailers to give prominence to a particular wine house Aging quality of wine The prestige of a wines vineyard and its legacy hence the appellations of estates and chateaux and references to the historic age of the establishment The complexity and sophistication of a wines taste including such things as tannins and oak A diverse range of wines to cover all varieties of grapes and consumer preferences from Chardonnay to Merlot and so on These factors were viewed as key to the promotion of wine as a unique beverage for the informed wine drinker worthy of special occasions That was essentially the underlying structure of the US wine industry from the market perspective Now lets turn to the vertical axis of the strategy canvas which captures the offering level that buyers receive across all these key competing factors A high score means that a company offers buyers more and hence invests more in that factor In the case of price a higher score indicates a higher price We can now plot the current offering of wineries across all these factors to understand wineries strategic profiles or value curves The value curve the basic component of the strategy canvas is a graphic depiction of a companys relative performance across its industrys factors of competition Figure 21 shows that although more than one thousand six hundred wineries participated in the US wine industry in 2000 from the buyers point of view there was enormous convergence in their value curves Despite the plethora of competitors when premium brand wines are plotted on the strategy canvas we discover that from the market point of view all of them essentially have the same strategic profile They offered a high price and presented a high level of offering across all the key competing factors Their strategic profile follows a classic differentiation strategy From the market point of view however they are all different in the same way On the other hand budget wines also have the same essential strategic profile Their price was low as was their offering across all the key competing factors These are classic lowcost players Moreover the value curves of premium and low cost wines share the same basic shape The two strategic groups strategies marched in lockstep but at different altitudes of offering level To set a company on a strong profitable growth trajectory in the face of industry conditions like these it wont work to benchmark competitors and try to outcompete them by offering a little more for a little less Such a strategy may nudge sales up but will hardly drive a company to open up uncontested market space Nor is conducting extensive customer research the path to blue oceans Our research found that customers can scarcely imagine how to create uncontested market space Their insight also tends toward the familiar offer me more for less And what customers typically want more of are those product and service features that the industry currently offers To fundamentally shift the strategy canvas of an industry you must begin by reorienting your strategic focus from competitors to alternatives and from customers to noncustomers of the industry1 To pursue both value and low cost you should resist the old logic of benchmarking competitors in the existing field and choosing between differentiation and cost leadership As you shift your strategic focus from current competition to alternatives and noncustomers you gain insight into how to redefine the problem the industry focuses on and thereby reconstruct buyer value elements that reside across industry boundaries Conventional strategic logic by contrast drives you to offer better solutions than your rivals to existing problems defined by your industry In the case of the US wine industry conventional wisdom caused wineries to focus on overdelivering on prestige and the quality of wine at its price point Overdelivery meant adding complexity to the wine based on taste profiles shared by wine makers and reinforced by the wine show judging system Wine makers show judges and knowledgeable drinkers concur that complexitylayered personality and characteristics that reflect the uniqueness of the soil season and wine makers skill in tannins oak and aging processesequates with quality By looking across alternatives however Casella Wines an Australian winery redefined the problem of the wine industry to a new one how to make a fun and nontraditional wine thats easy to drink for everyone Why In looking at the demand side of the alternatives of beer spirits and ready todrink cocktails which captured three times as many US consumer alcohol sales as wine at the time Casella Wines found that the mass of American adults saw wine as a turnoff It was intimidating and pretentious and the complexity of wines taste created flavor challenges for the average person even though it was the basis on which the industry fought to excel With this insight Casella Wines was ready to explore how to redraw the strategic profile of the US wine industry to create a blue ocean To achieve this it turned to the second basic analytic underlying blue oceans the four actions framework The Four Actions Framework To reconstruct buyer value elements in crafting a new value curve we have developed the four actions framework As shown in figure 22 to break the tradeoff between differentiation and low cost and to create a new value curve there are four key questions to challenge an industrys strategic logic and business model Which of the factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated Which factors should be reduced well below the industrys standard Which factors should be raised well above the industrys standard Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered FIGURE 22 The four actions framework The first question forces you to consider eliminating factors that companies in your industry have long competed on Often those factors are taken for granted even though they no longer have value or may even detract from value Sometimes there is a fundamental change in what buyers value but companies that are focused on benchmarking one another do not act on or even perceive the change The second question forces you to determine whether products or services have been overdesigned in the race to match and beat the competition Here companies overserve customers increasing their cost structure for no gain The third question pushes you to uncover and eliminate the compromises your industry forces customers to make The fourth question helps you to discover entirely new sources of value for buyers and to create new demand and shift the strategic pricing of the industry It is by pursuing the first two questions of eliminating and reducing that you gain insight into how to drop your cost structure visvis competitors Our research has found that rarely do managers systematically set out to eliminate and reduce their investments in factors that an industry competes on The result is mounting cost structures and complex business models The second two factors by contrast provide you with insight into how to lift buyer value and create new demand Collectively they allow you to systematically explore how you can reconstruct buyer value elements across alternative industries to offer buyers an entirely new experience while simultaneously keeping your cost structure low Of particular importance are the actions of eliminating and creating which push companies to go beyond value maximization exercises with existing factors of competition Eliminating and creating prompt companies to change the factors themselves hence making the existing rules of competition irrelevant When you apply the four actions framework to the strategy canvas of your industry you get a revealing new look at old perceived truths In the case of the US wine industry by thinking in terms of these four actions visvis the current industry logic and looking across alternatives and noncustomers Casella Wines created yellow tail a wine whose strategic profile broke from the competition and created a blue ocean Instead of offering wine as wine Casella created a social drink accessible to everyone beer drinkers cocktail drinkers and traditional drinkers of wine In the space of only two years the fun social drink yellow tail emerged as the fastestgrowing brand in the histories of both the Australian and the US wine industries and the numberone imported wine into the United States surpassing the wines of France and Italy By August 2003 it was the numberone red wine in a 750ml bottle sold in the United States outstripping California labels By mid2003 yellow tails moving average annual sales were tracking at 45 million cases In the context of a global wine glut yellow tail was racing to keep up with sales Today ten years later yellow tail is available in more than fifty countries with more than 25 million glasses of yellow tail enjoyed around the world each day In the space of a decade it emerged as one of the topfive most powerful wine brands in the world2 Whats more whereas large wine companies developed strong brands over decades of marketing investment yellow tail leapfrogged tall competitors with no promotional campaign mass media or consumer advertising for the initial years It didnt simply steal sales from competitors it grew the market yellow tail brought nonwine drinkersbeer and ready todrink cocktail consumersinto the wine market Moreover novice table wine drinkers started to drink wine more frequently jug wine drinkers moved up and drinkers of more expensive wines moved down to become consumers of yellow tail Figure 23 shows the extent to which the application of these four actions led to a break from the competition in the US wine industry Here we can graphically compare yellow tails blue ocean strategy with the more than one thousand six hundred wineries competing in the United States at the time As shown in figure 23 yellow tails value curve stands apart Casella Wines acted on all four actionseliminate reduce raise and createto unlock uncontested market space that changed the face of the US wine industry in a span of two years FIGURE 23 The strategy canvas of yellow tail By looking at the alternatives of beer and readytodrink cocktails and thinking in terms of noncustomers Casella Wines created three new factors in the US wine industryeasy drinking ease of selection and fun and adventureand eliminated or reduced everything else Casella Wines found that the mass of Americans rejected wine because its complicated taste was difficult to appreciate Beer and readytodrink cocktails for example were much sweeter and easier to drink Accordingly yellow tail was a completely new combination of wine characteristics that produced an uncomplicated wine structure that was instantly appealing to the mass of alcohol drinkers The wine was soft in taste and approachable like readyto drink cocktails and beer and had upfront primary flavors and pronounced fruit flavors The sweet fruitiness of the wine also kept peoples palate fresher allowing them to enjoy another glass of wine without thinking about it The result was an easydrinking wine that did not require years to develop an appreciation for In line with this simple fruity sweetness yellow tail dramatically reduced or eliminated all the factors the wine industry had long competed on tannins oak complexity and agingin crafting fine wine whether it was for the premium or the budget segment With the need for aging eliminated the needed working capital for aging wine at Casella Wines was also reduced creating a faster payback for the wine produced The wine industry criticized the sweet fruitiness of yellow tail wine seeing it as significantly lowering the quality of wine and working against proper appreciation of fine grapes and historic wine craftsmanship These claims may have been true but customers of all sorts loved the wine Wine retailers in the United States offered buyers aisles of wine varieties but to the general consumer the choice was overwhelming and intimidating The bottles looked the same labels were complicated with enological terminology understandable only to the wine connoisseur or hobbyist and the choice was so extensive that salesclerks at retail shops were at an equal disadvantage in understanding or recommending wine to bewildered potential buyers Moreover the rows of wine choice fatigued and demotivated customers making selection a difficult process that left the average wine purchaser insecure with their choice yellow tail changed all that by creating ease of selection It dramatically reduced the range of wines offered creating only two at the start Chardonnay the most popular white in the United States and a red Shiraz It removed all technical jargon from the bottles and created instead a striking simple and nontraditional label featuring a kangaroo in bright vibrant colors of orange and yellow on a black background The wine boxes yellow tail came in were also of the same vibrant colors with the name yellow tail printed boldly on the sides the boxes served the dual purpose of acting as eyecatching unintimidating displays for the wine yellow tail hit a home run in ease of selection when it made retail shop employees the ambassadors of yellow tail at its launch by giving them Australian outback clothing including bushmans hats and oilskin jackets to wear at work The retail employees were inspired by the branded clothing and having a wine they themselves did not feel intimidated by and recommendations to buy yellow tail flew out of their mouths In short it was fun to recommend yellow tail The simplicity of offering only two wines at the starta red and a white streamlined Casella Wines business model Minimizing the stockkeeping units maximized its stock turnover and minimized investment in warehouse inventory In fact this reduction of variety was carried over to the bottles inside the cases yellow tail broke industry conventions Casella Wines was the first company to put both red and white wine in the sameshaped bottle a practice that created further simplicity in manufacturing and purchasing and resulted in stunningly simple wine displays The wine industry worldwide was proud to promote wine as a refined beverage with a long history and tradition This is reflected in the target market for the United States educated professionals in the upperincome brackets Hence the continuous focus on the quality and legacy of the vineyard the chateaus or estates historical tradition and the wine medals won Indeed the growth strategies of the major players in the US wine industry were targeted at the premium end of the market with tens of millions invested in brand advertising to strengthen this image By looking to beer and readytodrink cocktail customers however yellow tail found that this elite image did not resonate with the general public which found it intimidating So yellow tail broke with tradition and created a personality that embodied the characteristics of the Australian culture bold laid back fun and adventurous Approachability was the mantra The essence of a great land Australia There was no traditional winery image The lowercase spelling of the name yellow tail coupled with the vibrant colors and the kangaroo motif echoed Australia and made people smile And indeed no reference to the vineyard was made on the bottle The wine promised to jump from the glass like an Aussie kangaroo The result is that yellow tail appealed to a broad cross section of alcohol beverage consumers By offering this leap in value yellow tail raised the price of its wines above the budget market pricing them then at 699 a bottle more than double the price of a jug wine at the time From the moment the wine hit the retail shelves in July 2001 sales took off Today over a decade later its price stands at 749 in the United States The EliminateReduceRaiseCreate Grid There is a third tool that is key to creation of blue oceans It is a supplementary analytic to the four actions framework called the eliminate reduceraisecreate grid see figure 24 The grid pushes companies not only to ask all four questions in the four actions framework but also to act on all four to create a new value curve By driving companies to fill in the grid with the actions of eliminating and reducing as well as raising and creating the grid gives companies four immediate benefits FIGURE 24 Eliminatereduceraisecreate grid The case of yellow tail It pushes them to simultaneously pursue differentiation and low costs to break the valuecost tradeoff It immediately flags companies that are focused only on raising and creating and thereby lifting their cost structure and often overengineering products and servicesa common plight in many companies It is easily understood by managers at any level creating a high level of engagement in its application Because completing the grid is a challenging task it drives companies to robustly scrutinize every factor the industry competes on making them discover the range of implicit assumptions they make unconsciously in competing Figure 25 the eliminatereduceraisecreate grid for Cirque du Soleil provides another snapshot of this tool in action and shows what it reveals Worth noting is the range of factors that an industry has long competed on that companies discover can be eliminated and reduced In the case of Cirque du Soleil it eliminated several factors from traditional circuses such as animal shows star performers and multiple show arenas These factors had long been taken for granted in the traditional circus industry which never questioned their ongoing relevance However there was increasing public discomfort with the use of animals Moreover animal acts are one of the most expensive elements not only is there the cost of the animals but also their training medical care housing insurance and transportation Similarly although the circus industry focused on featuring stars in the mind of the public the socalled stars of the circus were trivial next to movie stars or famous singers Again they were a highcost component carrying little sway with spectators Gone too are threering venues Not only did these create angst among spectators as they rapidly switched their gaze from one ring to the other but they also increased the number of performers needed with the obvious cost implications FIGURE 25 Eliminatereduceraisecreate grid The case of Cirque du Soleil Three Characteristics of a Good Strategy yellow tail like Cirque du Soleil created a unique and exceptional value curve to unlock a blue ocean As shown in the strategy canvas yellow tails value curve has focus the company did not diffuse its efforts across all key factors of competition The shape of its value curve diverged from the other players a result of not benchmarking competitors but instead looking across alternatives The tagline of yellow tails strategic profile was clear a fun and simple wine to be enjoyed every day When expressed through a value curve then an effective blue ocean strategy like yellow tails has three complementary qualities focus divergence and a compelling tagline Without these qualities a companys strategy will likely be muddled undifferentiated and hard to communicate with a high cost structure The four actions of creating a new value curve should be well guided toward building a companys strategic profile with these characteristics These three characteristics serve as an initial litmus test of the commercial viability of blue ocean ideas A look at Southwest Airlines strategic profile illustrates how these three qualities underlie the companys effective strategy in reinventing the short haul airline industry via value innovation see figure 26 Southwest Airlines created a blue ocean by breaking the tradeoffs customers had to make between the speed of airplanes and the economy and flexibility of car transport To achieve this Southwest offered highspeed transport with frequent and flexible departures at prices attractive to the mass of buyers By eliminating and reducing certain factors of competition and raising others in the traditional airline industry as well as by creating new factors drawn from the alternative industry of car transport Southwest Airlines was able to offer unprecedented utility for air travelers and achieve a leap in value with a lowcost business model The value curve of Southwest Airlines differs distinctively from those of its competitors in the strategy canvas Its strategic profile is a typical example of a compelling blue ocean strategy Focus Every great strategy has focus and a companys strategic profile or value curve should clearly show it Looking at Southwests profile we can see at once that the company emphasizes only three factors friendly service speed and frequent pointtopoint departures By focusing in this way Southwest has been able to price against car transportation it doesnt make extra investments in meals lounges and seating choices By contrast Southwests traditional competitors invest in all the airline industrys competitive factors making it much more difficult for them to match Southwests prices Investing across the board these companies let their competitors moves set their own agendas Costly business models result FIGURE 26 The strategy canvas of Southwest Airlines Divergence When a companys strategy is formed reactively as it tries to keep up with the competition it loses its uniqueness Consider the similarities in most airlines meals and businessclass lounges On the strategy canvas therefore reactive strategists tend to share the same strategic profile Indeed in the case of Southwest the value curves of the companys competitors are virtually identical and therefore can be summarized on the strategy canvas with a single value curve In contrast the value curves of blue ocean strategists always stand apart By applying the four actions of eliminating reducing raising and creating they differentiate their profiles from the industrys average profile Southwest for example pioneered pointtopoint travel between midsize cities previously the industry operated through hubandspoke systems Compelling Tagline A good strategy has a clearcut and compelling tagline The speed of a plane at the price of a carwhenever you need it Thats the tagline of Southwest Airlines or at least it could be What could Southwests competitors say Even the most proficient ad agency would have difficulty reducing the conventional offering of meals seat choices lounges and hub links with standard service slower speeds and higher prices into a memorable tagline A good tagline must not only deliver a clear message but also advertise an offering truthfully or else customers will lose trust and interest In fact a good way to test the effectiveness and strength of a strategy is to look at whether it contains a strong and authentic tagline As shown in figure 27 Cirque du Soleils strategic profile also met the three criteria that define blue ocean strategy focus divergence and a compelling tagline Cirque du Soleils strategy canvas allows us to graphically compare its strategic profile with those of its major competitors The canvas shows clearly the extent of Cirque du Soleils departure from the conventional logic of the circus The figure shows that the value curve of Ringling Bros and Barnum Bailey is the same basic shape as those of smaller regional circuses The main difference is that regional circuses offer less of each competing factor because of their restricted resources By contrast Cirque du Soleils value curve stands apart It has new and noncircus factors such as theme multiple productions refined watching environment and artistic music and dance These factors entirely new creations for the circus industry are drawn from the alternative live entertainment industry of theater In this way the strategy canvas clearly depicts the traditional factors that affect competition among industry players as well as new factors that lead to creation of new market space and that shift the strategy canvas of an industry FIGURE 27 The strategy canvas of Cirque du Soleil yellow tail Cirque du Soleil and Southwest Airlines created blue oceans in very different business situations and industrial contexts However their strategic profiles shared the same three characteristics focus divergence and a compelling tagline These three criteria guide companies in carrying out the process of reconstruction to arrive at a breakthrough in value both for buyers and for themselves Reading the Value Curves The strategy canvas enables companies to see the future in the present To achieve this companies must understand how to read value curves Embedded in the value curves of an industry is a wealth of strategic knowledge on the current status and future of a business A Blue Ocean Strategy The first question the value curves answer is whether a business deserves to be a winner When a companys value curve or its competitors meets the three criteria that define a good blue ocean strategyfocus divergence and a compelling tagline that speaks to the marketthe company is on the right track These three criteria serve as an initial litmus test of the commercial viability of blue ocean ideas On the other hand when a companys value curve lacks focus its cost structure will tend to be high and its business model complex in implementation and execution When it lacks divergence a companys strategy is a metoo with no reason to stand apart in the marketplace When it lacks a compelling tagline that speaks to buyers it is likely to be internally driven or a classic example of innovation for innovations sake with no great commercial potential and no natural takeoff capability A Company Caught in the Red Ocean When a companys value curve converges with its competitors it signals that a company is likely caught within the red ocean of bloody competition A companys explicit or implicit strategy tends to be trying to outdo its competition on the basis of cost or quality This signals slow growth unless by the grace of luck the company benefits from being in an industry that is growing on its own accord This growth is not due to a companys strategy however but to luck Overdelivery without Payback When a companys value curve on the strategy canvas is shown to deliver high levels across all factors the question is Does the companys market share and profitability reflect these investments If not the strategy canvas signals that the company may be oversupplying its customers offering too much of those elements that add incremental value to buyers To value innovate the company must decide which factors to eliminate and reduce and not only those to raise and createto construct a divergent value curve Strategic Contradictions Are there strategic contradictions These are areas where a company is offering a high level on one competing factor while ignoring others that support that factor An example is investing heavily in making a companys website easy to use but failing to correct the sites slow speed of operation Strategic inconsistencies can also be found between the level of your offering and your price For example a petroleum station company found that it offered less for more fewer services than the best competitor at a higher price No wonder it was losing market share fast An Internally Driven Company In drawing the strategy canvas how does a company label the industrys competing factors For example does it use the word megahertz instead of speed or thermal water temperature instead of hot water Are the competing factors stated in terms buyers can understand and value or are they in operational jargon The kind of language used in the strategy canvas gives insight as to whether a companys strategic vision is built on an outsidein perspective driven by the demand side or an insideout perspective that is operationally driven Analyzing the language of the strategy canvas helps a company understand how far it is from creating industry demand The tools and frameworks introduced here are essential analytics used throughout this book and supplementary tools are introduced in other chapters as needed It is the intersection between these analytic techniques and the eight principles of formulating and executing blue oceans that allow companies to break from the competition and unlock uncontested market space Now we move on to the first principle reconstructing market boundaries In the next chapter we discuss the opportunitymaximizing and risk minimizing paths to creating blue oceans PART TWO Formulating Blue Ocean Strategy CHAPTER 3 Reconstruct Market Boundaries THE FIRST PRINCIPLE of blue ocean strategy is to reconstruct market boundaries to break from the competition and create blue oceans This principle addresses the search risk many companies struggle with The challenge is to successfully identify out of the haystack of possibilities that exist commercially compelling blue ocean opportunities This challenge is key because managers cannot afford to be riverboat gamblers betting their strategy on intuition or on a random drawing In conducting our research we sought to discover whether there were systematic patterns for reconstructing market boundaries to create blue oceans And if there were we wanted to know whether these patterns applied across all types of industry sectorsfrom consumer goods to industrial products to finance and services to telecoms and IT to pharmaceuticals and B2 Bor were they limited to specific industries We found clear patterns for creating blue oceans Specifically we found six basic approaches to remaking market boundaries We call this the six paths framework These paths have general applicability across industry sectors and they lead companies into the corridor of commercially viable blue ocean ideas None of these paths requires special vision or foresight about the future All are based on looking at familiar data from a new perspective These paths challenge the six fundamental assumptions underlying many companies strategies These six assumptions on which most companies hypnotically build their strategies keep companies trapped competing in red oceans Specifically companies tend to do the following Define their industry similarly and focus on being the best within it Look at their industries through the lens of generally accepted strategic groups such as luxury automobiles economy cars and family vehicles and strive to stand out in the strategic group they play in Focus on the same buyer group be it the purchaser as in the office equipment industry the user as in the clothing industry or the influencer as in the pharmaceutical industry Define the scope of the products and services offered by their industry similarly Accept their industrys functional or emotional orientation Focus on the same point in timeand often on current competitive threatsin formulating strategy The more that companies share this conventional wisdom about how they compete the greater the competitive convergence among them To break out of red oceans companies must break out of the accepted boundaries that define how they compete Instead of looking within these boundaries managers need to look systematically across them to create blue oceans They need to look across alternative industries across strategic groups across buyer groups across complementary product and service offerings across the functionalemotional orientation of an industry and even across time This gives companies keen insight into how to reconstruct market realities to open up blue oceans Lets examine how each of these six paths works Path 1 Look Across Alternative Industries In the broadest sense a company competes not only with the other firms in its own industry but also with companies in those other industries that produce alternative products or services Alternatives are broader than substitutes Products or services that have different forms but offer the same functionality or core utility are often substitutes for each other On the other hand alternatives include products or services that have different functions and forms but the same purpose For example to sort out their personal finances people can buy and install a financial software package hire a CPA or simply use pencil and paper And nowadays there are also apps that help with this The software the CPA the pencil and financial apps are largely substitutes for each other They have very different forms but serve the same function helping people manage their financial affairs In contrast products or services can take different forms and perform different functions but serve the same objective Consider cinemas versus restaurants Restaurants have few physical features in common with cinemas and serve a distinct function they provide conversational and gastronomical pleasure This is a very different experience from the visual entertainment offered by cinemas Despite the differences in form and function however people go to a restaurant for the same objective that they go to the movies to enjoy a night out These are not substitutes but alternatives to choose from In making every purchase decision buyers implicitly weigh alternatives often unconsciously Do you need a selfindulgent two hours What should you do to achieve it Do you go to the movies have a massage or enjoy reading a favorite book at a local caf The thought process is intuitive for individual consumers and industrial buyers alike For some reason we often abandon this intuitive thinking when we become sellers Rarely do sellers think consciously about how their customers make tradeoffs across alternative industries A shift in price a change in model even a new ad campaign can elicit a tremendous response from rivals within an industry but the same actions in an alternative industry usually go unnoticed Trade journals trade shows and consumer rating reports reinforce the vertical walls between one industry and another Often however the space between alternative industries provides opportunities for value innovation Consider NetJets which created the blue ocean of fractional jet ownership In less than twenty years since its inception NetJets grew larger than many airlines with more than five hundred aircraft operating more than two hundred fifty thousand flights to more than one hundred forty countries Today those numbers are even higher with a fleet of over seven hundred aircraft flying to over one hundred seventy countries Purchased by Berkshire Hathaway in 1998 NetJets is a multibilliondollar business with the largest private jet fleet in the world NetJets success has been attributed to its flexibility shortened travel time hasslefree travel experience increased reliability and strategic pricing The reality is that NetJets reconstructed market boundaries to create this blue ocean by looking across alternative industries The most lucrative mass of customers in the aviation industry is corporate travelers NetJets looked at the existing alternatives and found that when business travelers want to fly they have two principal choices On the one hand a companys executives can fly business class or first class on a commercial airline On the other hand a company can purchase its own aircraft to serve its corporate travel needs The strategic question is Why would corporations choose one alternative industry over another By focusing on the key factors that lead corporations to trade across alternatives and eliminating or reducing everything else NetJets created its blue ocean strategy Consider this Why do corporations choose to use commercial airlines for their corporate travel Surely its not because of the long checkin and security lines hectic flight transfers overnight stays or congested airports Rather they choose commercial airlines for only one reason costs On the one hand commercial travel avoids the high upfront fixedcost investment of a multimilliondollar jet aircraft On the other hand a company purchases only the number of corporate airline tickets needed per year lowering variable costs and reducing the possibility of unused aviation travel time that often accompanies the ownership of corporate jets So NetJets created the concept of selling fractions of jets which can be as small as onesixteenth ownership of an aircraft in the United States entitling customers to fifty flight hours per year Starting at just over 400000 plus pilot maintenance and other monthly costs owners can purchase a share in a 7 million aircraft1 Customers get the convenience of a private jet at the price of firstand businessclass air travel Comparing firstclass travel with private aircraft the National Business Aviation Association found that when direct and indirect costshotel meals travel time expenseswere factored in the cost of firstclass commercial travel was higher2 As for NetJets it avoids the fixed costs that commercial airlines attempt to cover by filling larger and larger aircraft NetJets smaller airplanes the use of smaller regional airports and limited staff help to keep costs low To understand the rest of the NetJets formula consider the flip side Why do people choose corporate jets over commercial travel Certainly it is not to pay the multimilliondollar price to purchase planes Nor is it to set up a dedicated flight department to take care of scheduling and other administrative matters Nor is it to pay socalled deadhead coststhe costs of flying the aircraft from its home base to where it is needed Rather corporations and wealthy individuals buy private jets to dramatically cut total travel time to reduce the hassle of congested airports to allow for pointtopoint travel and to gain the benefit of being more productive and arriving energized ready to hit the ground running So NetJets built on these distinctive strengths Whereas 70 percent of commercial flights go to only thirty airports across the United States NetJets offers access to more than two thousand airports in the US and five thousand airports around the world with convenient locations near business centers and popular destinations On international flights your plane pulls directly up to the customs office With pointtopoint service and the exponential increase in the number of airports to land in there are no flight transfers trips that would otherwise require overnight stays can be completed in a single day The time from your car to takeoff is measured in minutes instead of hours For example whereas a flight from Washington DC to Sacramento would take on average 105 hours using commercial airlines it is only 52 hours on a NetJets aircraft from Palm Springs to Cabo San Lucas takes on average 6 hours commercial and only 21 hours via NetJets NetJets offers substantial cost savings in total travel time Perhaps most appealing your jet is always available with only four hours notice If a jet is not available NetJets will charter one for you Last but not least NetJets dramatically reduces issues related to security threats and offers clients customized inflight service such as having your favorite food and beverages ready for you when you board By offering the best of commercial travel and private jets and eliminating and reducing everything else NetJets opened up a multibilliondollar blue ocean wherein customers get the convenience and speed of a private jet with a low fixed cost and the lower variable cost of firstand businessclass commercial airline travel see figure 31 And the competition Now nearly thirty years later NetJets share of the blue ocean it unlocked still stands a staggering five times greater than that of its nearest competitor3 FIGURE 31 The strategy canvas of NetJets The biggest telecommunications success in Japan since the 1980s also has its roots in path 1 Here we are speaking of NTT DoCoMos imode which was launched in 1999 The imode service changed the way people communicate and access information in Japan NTT DoCoMos insight into creating a blue ocean came by thinking about why people trade across the alternatives of mobile phones and the internet With deregulation of the Japanese telecommunications industry new competitors were entering the market and price competition and technological races were the norm The result was that costs were rising while the average revenue per user fell NTT DoCoMo broke out of this red ocean of bloody competition by creating a blue ocean of wireless transmission that reconstructed the mobile phone industry and the internet NTT DoCoMo asked What are the distinctive strengths of the internet over cell phones and vice versa Although the internet offered endless information and services the killer apps were email simple information such as news weather forecasts and a telephone directory and entertainment including games events and music entertainment The key downside of the internet was the far higher price of computer hardware needed to access the internet at the time an overload of information the nuisance of logging on to go online and the fear of giving credit card information over the internet On the other hand the distinctive strengths of mobile phones were their mobility voice transmission and ease of use NTT DoCoMo broke the tradeoff that existed at the time between these two alternatives not by creating new technology but by focusing on the decisive advantages that the internet has over the cell phone and vice versa The company eliminated or reduced everything else Its userfriendly interface has one simple button the imode button i standing for interactive internet information and the English pronoun I which users press to give them immediate access to the few killer apps of the internet Instead of barraging you with infinite information as on the internet however the i mode button acts as a hotel concierge service connecting only to preselected and preapproved sites for the most popular internet applications That makes navigation fast and easy At the same time even though the imode phone was priced 25 percent higher than a regular cell phone the price of the i mode phone was dramatically less than that of a PC or laptop which were the dominant means to access the internet at the time and its mobility was high Moreover beyond adding voice the imode used a simple billing service whereby all the services used on the web via the imode got billed to the user on the same monthly bill This dramatically reduced the number of bills users received and eliminated the need to give credit card details on the internet And because the imode service was automatically turned on whenever the phone was on users were always connected and had no need to go through the hassle of logging on Neither the standard cell phone nor the PC or laptop could compete with i modes divergent value curve By 2009 ten years after its launch imode subscribers had climbed to just shy of 50 million and its revenue from the transmission of data pictures and text increased from 295 million yen 26 million in 1999 to 1589 billion yen 17 billion The imode service did not simply win customers from competitors It dramatically grew the market drawing in youth and senior citizens and converting voiceonly customers to voice and data transmission customers The imode was the worlds first smart phone to achieve mass adoption by a country It wasnt until 2007 that the iPhone was launched which seriously challenged the imode and created a new and even larger blue ocean space with the introduction of apps see path 4 Many other wellknown success stories have looked across alternatives to create new markets The Home Depot offered the expertise of professional home contractors at markedly lower prices than hardware stores By delivering the decisive advantages of both alternative industriesand eliminating or reducing everything elseThe Home Depot has transformed enormous latent demand for home improvement into real demand making ordinary homeowners into doityourselfers Today it is the worlds largest home retail improvement store Southwest Airlines concentrated on driving as the alternative to flying providing the speed of air travel at the price and flexibility of car travel to create the blue ocean of shorthaul air travel Similarly Intuit looked to the pencil as the chief alternative to personal financial software to develop the fun and intuitive Quicken software Today more than thirty years on Quicken still remains the numberoneselling personal financial software even as Intuit explores the creation of new blue oceans in online financial services and apps What are the alternative industries to your industry Why do customers trade across them By focusing on the key factors that lead buyers to trade across alternative industries and eliminating or reducing everything else you can create a blue ocean of new market space Path 2 Look Across Strategic Groups within Industries Just as blue oceans can often be created by looking across alternative industries so can they be unlocked by looking across strategic groups The term refers to a group of companies within an industry that pursue a similar strategy In most industries the fundamental strategic differences among industry players are captured by a small number of strategic groups Strategic groups can generally be ranked in a rough hierarchical order built on two dimensions price and performance Each jump in price tends to bring a corresponding jump in some dimensions of performance Most companies focus on improving their competitive position within a strategic group Mercedes BMW and Jaguar for example focus on outcompeting one another in the luxury car segment as economy carmakers focus on excelling over one another in their strategic group Neither strategic group however pays much heed to what the other is doing because from a supply point of view they do not seem to be competing The key to creating a blue ocean across existing strategic groups is to break out of this narrow tunnel vision by understanding which factors determine customers decisions to trade up or down from one group to another Consider Curves the Texasbased womens fitness company which began franchising in 1995 In the space of ten years it had more than two million members Whats more this growth was triggered almost entirely through word of mouth and buddy referrals Yet at its inception Curves was seen as entering an oversaturated market gearing its offering to customers who would not want it and making its offering significantly blander than the competitions In reality however Curves created new demand in the US fitness industry unlocking an untapped market a veritable blue ocean of women struggling and failing to keep in shape through sound fitness Curves built on the decisive advantages of two strategic groups in the US fitness industrytraditional health clubs and home exercise programsand eliminated or reduced everything else At the one extreme the US fitness industry was awash with traditional health clubs that catered to both men and women offering a full range of exercise and sporting options usually in upscale urban locations Their trendy facilities were designed to attract the highend health club set They had the full range of aerobic and strength training machines a juice bar instructors and a full locker room with showers and sauna because the aim was for customers to spend social as well as exercise time there Having fought their way across town to health clubs customers would typically spend at least an hour there and more often two Membership fees for all this were in the range of 100 per month at the timenot cheap guaranteeing that the market would stay upscale and small Traditional health club customers represented only 12 percent of the entire population concentrated overwhelmingly in the larger urban areas Investment costs for a traditional fullservice health club ran from 500000 to more than 1 million depending on the city center location At the other extreme was the strategic group of home exercise programs such as exercise videos books and magazines These were a small fraction of the cost were used at home and generally required little or no exercise equipment Instruction was minimal being confined to the star of the exercise video or book and magazine explanations and illustrations The question is What made women trade either up or down between traditional health clubs and home exercise programs Most women dont trade up to health clubs for the profusion of special machines juice bars locker rooms with sauna pool and the chance to meet men The average female nonathlete does not even want to run into men when she is working out perhaps revealing lumps in her leotards She is not inspired to line up behind machines in which she needs to change weights and adjust their incline angles As for time it has become an increasingly scarce commodity for the average woman Few can afford to spend one to two hours at a health club several times a week For the mass of women the city center locations also present traffic challenges something that increases stress and discourages going to the gym It turns out that most women trade up to health clubs for one principal reason When they are at home its too easy to find an excuse for not working out It is hard to be disciplined in the confines of ones home if you are not already a committed sports enthusiast Working out collectively instead of alone is more motivating and inspiring Conversely women who use home exercise programs do so primarily for the time saving lower costs and privacy Curves built its blue ocean by drawing on the distinctive strengths of these two strategic groups eliminating and reducing everything else see figure 3 2 Curves eliminated all the aspects of the traditional health club that are of little interest to the broad mass of women Gone are the profusion of special machines food spa pool and even locker rooms which have been replaced by a few curtainedoff changing areas The experience in a Curves club was entirely different from that in a typical health club The member entered the exercise room where the machines typically about ten were arranged not in rows facing a television as in the health club but in a circle to facilitate interchange among members making the experience fun The QuickFit circuit training system used hydraulic exercise machines which needed no adjusting and were safe simple to use and nonthreatening Specifically designed for women these machines reduced impact stress and built strength and muscle While exercising members could talk and support one another and the social nonjudgmental atmosphere was totally different from that of a typical health club There were few if any mirrors on the wall and there were no men staring at you Members moved around the circle of machines and aerobic pads and in thirty minutes completed the whole workout The result of reducing and focusing service on the essentials was that prices fell to around 30 per month opening the market to the broad mass of women Curves tagline could have been for the price of a cup of coffee a day you can obtain the gift of health through proper exercise FIGURE 32 The strategy canvas of Curves Curves offered the distinctive value depicted in figure 32 at a lower cost Compared with the startup investment of 500000 to 1 million for traditional health clubs startup investments for Curves were in the range of only 25000 to 30000 excluding a 20000 franchise fee because of the wide range of factors the company eliminated Variable costs were also significantly lower with personnel and maintenance of facilities dramatically reduced and rent reduced because of the much smaller spaces required 1500 square feet in nonprime suburban locations versus 35000 to 100000 square feet in prime urban locations Curves lowcost business model made its franchises easy to afford and helps explain why they mushroomed quickly Most franchises were profitable within a few months as soon as they recruited on average one hundred members The result is that Curves did not compete directly with other health and exercise concepts it created new demand Today twenty years out it has nearly ten thousand clubs worldwide serving more than four million members4 Despite bumps along the way it has become the largest womens fitness franchise in the world Beyond Curves many companies have created blue oceans by looking across strategic groups Ralph Lauren created the blue ocean of high fashion with no fashion Its designer name the elegance of its stores and the luxury of its materials capture what most customers value in haute couture At the same time its updated classical look and price capture the best of the classical lines such as Brooks Brothers and Burberry By combining the most attractive factors of both groups and eliminating or reducing everything else Polo Ralph Lauren not only captured share from both segments but also drew many new customers into the market In the luxury car market Toyotas Lexus carved out a new blue ocean by offering the quality of the highend Mercedes BMW and Jaguar at a price closer to the lowerend Cadillac and Lincoln Michiganbased Champion Enterprises identified a similar opportunity by looking across two strategic groups in the housing industry makers of prefabricated housing and onsite developers Prefabricated houses were historically cheap and quick to build but they were also dismally standardized with a lowquality image Houses built by developers onsite offer variety and an image of high quality but are dramatically more expensive and take longer to build Champion created a blue ocean by offering the decisive advantages of both strategic groups Its prefabricated houses were quick to build and benefited from tremendous economies of scale and lower costs but Champion also allowed buyers to choose such highend finishing touches as fireplaces skylights and even vaulted ceilings to give the homes a personal feel In essence Champion changed the definition of prefabricated housing As a result more lowand middleincome buyers became interested in purchasing prefabricated housing rather than renting or buying an apartment and even some affluent people were drawn into the market It was only the financial crisis of 2008 that put a damper on this blue ocean strategic move hitting Champion hard as it hit the rest of the US housing industry What are the strategic groups in your industry Why do customers trade up for the higher group and why do they trade down for the lower one Path 3 Look Across the Chain of Buyers In most industries competitors converge around a common definition of who the target buyer is In reality though there is a chain of buyers who are directly or indirectly involved in the buying decision The purchasers who pay for the product or service may differ from the actual users and in some cases there are important influencers as well Although these three groups may overlap they often differ When they do they frequently hold different definitions of value A corporate purchasing agent for example may be more concerned with costs than the corporate user who is likely to be far more concerned with ease of use Similarly a retailer may value a manufacturers justintime stock replenishment and innovative financing But consumer purchasers although strongly influenced by the channel do not value these things Individual companies in an industry often target different customer segmentsfor example large versus small customers But an industry typically converges on a single buyer group The pharmaceutical industry for example focuses overridingly on influencers doctors The office equipment industry focuses heavily on purchasers corporate purchasing departments And the clothing industry sells predominantly to users Sometimes there is a strong economic rationale for this focus But often it is the result of industry practices that have never been questioned Challenging an industrys conventional wisdom about which buyer group to target can lead to the discovery of a new blue ocean By looking across buyer groups companies can gain new insights into how to redesign their value curves to focus on a previously overlooked set of buyers Think of Novo Nordisk the Danish insulin producer that created a blue ocean in the insulin industry Insulin is used by diabetics to regulate the level of sugar in their blood Historically the insulin industry like most of the pharmaceutical industry focused its attention on the key influencers doctors The importance of doctors in affecting the insulin purchasing decision of diabetics made doctors the target buyer group of the industry Accordingly the industry geared its attention and efforts to produce purer insulin in response to doctors quest for better medication The issue was that innovations in purification technology had improved dramatically by the early 1980s As long as the purity of insulin was the major parameter upon which companies competed little progress could be made further in that direction Novo itself had already created the first human monocomponent insulin that was a chemically exact copy of human insulin Competitive convergence among the major players was rapidly occurring Novo Nordisk however saw that it could break away from the competition and create a blue ocean by shifting the industrys longstanding focus on doctors to the userspatients themselves In focusing on patients Novo Nordisk found that insulin which was supplied to diabetes patients in vials presented significant challenges in administering Vials left the patient with the complex and unpleasant task of handling syringes needles and insulin and of administering doses according to his or her needs Needles and syringes also evoked unpleasant feelings of social stigmatism for patients And patients did not want to fiddle with syringes and needles outside their homes a frequent occurrence because many patients must inject insulin several times a day This led Novo Nordisk to the blue ocean opportunity of NovoPen NovoPen the first userfriendly insulin delivery solution was designed to remove the hassle and embarrassment of administering insulin The NovoPen resembled a fountain pen it contained an insulin cartridge that allowed the patient to easily carry in one selfcontained unit roughly a weeks worth of insulin The pen had an integrated click mechanism making it possible for even blind patients to control the dosing and administer insulin Patients could take the pen with them and inject insulin with ease and convenience without the embarrassing complexity of syringes and needles To dominate the blue ocean it had unlocked Novo Nordisk followed this up by introducing NovoLet a prefilled disposable insulin injection pen with a dosing system that provided users with even greater convenience and ease of use And it later brought out the Innovo an integrated electronic memory and cartridgebased delivery system Innovo was designed to manage the delivery of insulin through builtin memory and to display the dose the last dose and the elapsed timeinformation that is critical for reducing risk and eliminating worries about missing a dose Novo Nordisks blue ocean strategy shifted the industry landscape and transformed the company from an insulin producer to a diabetes care company NovoPen and the later delivery systems swept over the insulin market Sales of insulin in prefilled devices or pens now account for the dominant share in Europe Asia and Scandinavia where patients are advised to take frequent injections of insulin every day Today almost thirty years since its initial blue ocean strategic move Novo Nordisk remains the global leader in diabetes care with some 70 percent of its total turnover coming from this offering which originated largely in the companys thinking in terms of users rather than influencers Similarly consider Bloomberg In a little more than a decade Bloomberg became one of the largest and most profitable businessinformation providers in the world Until Bloombergs debut Reuters and Telerate dominated the online financialinformation industry providing news and prices in real time to the brokerage and investment community The industry focused on purchasersIT managerswho valued standardized systems which made their lives easier This made no sense to Bloomberg Traders and analysts not IT managers make or lose millions of dollars for their employers each day Profit opportunities come from disparities in information When markets are active traders and analysts must make rapid decisions Every second counts So Bloomberg designed a system specifically to offer traders better value one with easytouse terminals and keyboards labeled with familiar financial terms The systems also have two flatpanel monitors so that traders can see all the information they need at once without having to open and close numerous windows Because traders must analyze information before they act Bloomberg added a builtin analytic capability that works with the press of a button Before traders and analysts had to download data and use a pencil and calculator to perform important financial calculations After Bloomberg users could quickly run what if scenarios to compute returns on alternative investments and they could perform longitudinal analyses of historical data By focusing on users Bloomberg was also able to see the paradox of traders and analysts personal lives They have tremendous income but work such long hours that they have little time to spend it Realizing that markets have slow times during the day when little trading takes place Bloomberg decided to add information and purchasing services aimed at enhancing traders personal lives Well before the internet offered such services traders could use Bloomberg online services to buy items such as flowers clothing and jewelry make travel arrangements get information about wines or search through real estate listings By shifting its focus upstream from purchasers to users Bloomberg created a value curve that was radically different from anything the industry had seen before The traders and analysts wielded their power within their firms to force IT managers to purchase Bloomberg terminals Many industries afford similar opportunities to create blue oceans By questioning conventional definitions of who can and should be the target buyer companies can often see fundamentally new ways to unlock value Consider how Canon copiers created the small desktop copier industry by shifting the target customer of the copier industry from corporate purchasers to users Or how SAP shifted the customer focus of the business application software industry from the functional user to the corporate purchaser to create its enormously successful realtime integrated software business What is the chain of buyers in your industry Which buyer group does your industry typically focus on If you shifted the buyer group of your industry how could you unlock new value5 Path 4 Look Across Complementary Product and Service Offerings Few products and services are used in a vacuum In most cases other products and services affect their value But in most industries rivals converge within the bounds of their industrys product and service offerings Take movie theaters The ease and cost of getting a babysitter and parking the car affect the perceived value of going to the movies Yet these complementary services are beyond the bounds of the movie theater industry as it has been traditionally defined Few cinema operators worry about how hard or costly it is for people to get babysitters But they should because it affects demand for their business Imagine a movie theater with a babysitting service Untapped value is often hidden in complementary products and services The key is to define the total solution buyers seek when they choose a product or service A simple way to do so is to think about what happens before during and after your product is used Babysitting and parking the car are needed before people can go to the movies Operating and application software are used along with computer hardware In the airline industry ground transportation is used after the flight but is clearly part of what the customer needs to travel from one place to another Consider NABI a Hungarian bus company that was recently acquired by New Flyer It applied path 4 to the 1 billionplus US transit bus industry The major customers in the industry are public transport properties PTPs municipally owned transportation companies serving fixedroute public bus transportation in major cities or counties Under the accepted rules of competition in the industry companies long competed to offer the lowest purchase price Designs were outdated delivery times were late quality was low and the price of options was prohibitive given the industrys pennypinching approach To NABI however none of this made sense Why were bus companies focused only on the initial purchase price of the bus when municipalities kept buses in circulation for twelve years on average When it framed the market in this way NABI saw insights that had escaped the entire industry NABI discovered that the highestcost element to municipalities was not the price of the bus per se the factor the whole industry competed on but rather the costs that came after the bus was purchased the maintenance of running the bus over its twelveyear life cycle Repairs after traffic accidents fuel usage wear and tear on parts that frequently needed to be replaced due to the buss heavy weight preventive body work to stop rusting and the likethese were the highestcost factors to municipalities With new demands for clean air being placed on municipalities the cost for public transport not being environmentally friendly was also beginning to be felt Yet despite all these costs which outstripped the initial bus price the industry had virtually overlooked the complementary activity of maintenance and lifecycle costs This made NABI realize that the transit bus industry did not have to be a commoditypricedriven industry but that bus companies focusing on selling buses at the lowest possible price had largely made it that way By looking at the total solution of complementary activities NABI created a bus unlike any the industry had seen before Buses were normally made from steel which was heavy corrosive and hard to repair after accidents because entire panels had to be replaced NABI adopted fiberglass in making its buses a practice that killed five birds with one stone Fiberglass bodies substantially cut the costs of preventive maintenance by being corrosionfree It made body repairs faster cheaper and easier because fiberglass does not require panel replacements for dents and accidents rather damaged parts are simply cut out and new fiberglass materials are easily soldered At the same time its light weight 3035 percent lighter than steel cut fuel consumption and emissions substantially making the buses more environmentally friendly Moreover its light weight allowed NABI to use not only lowerpowered engines but also fewer axles resulting in lower manufacturing costs and more space inside the bus FIGURE 33 The strategy canvas of the US municipal bus industry circa 2001 In this way NABI created a value curve that was radically divergent from the industrys average curve As you can see in figure 33 by building its buses in lightweight fiberglass NABI eliminated or significantly reduced costs related to corrosion prevention maintenance and fuel consumption As a result even though NABI charged a higher initial purchase price than the average price of the industry at the time it offered its buses at a much lower lifecycle cost to municipalities With much lighter emissions the NABI buses raised the level of environmental friendliness high above the industry standard Moreover the higher price NABI charged allowed it to create factors unprecedented in the industry such as modern aesthetic design and customer friendliness including lower floors for easy mounting and more seats for less standing These boosted demand for transit bus service generating more revenues for municipalities NABI changed the way municipalities saw their revenues and costs involved in transit bus service NABI created exceptional value for the buyersin this case for both municipalities and end usersat a low lifecycle cost Municipalities and riders loved NABIs new buses with ridership expanding by as much as 30 percent when NABIs new buses were deployed6 Similarly consider the British teakettle industry which despite its importance to British culture had flat sales and shrinking profit margins until Philips Electronics came along with a teakettle that turned the red ocean blue By thinking in terms of complementary products and services Philips saw that the biggest issue the British had in brewing tea was not in the kettle itself but in the complementary product of water which had to be boiled in the kettle The issue was the lime scale found in tap water The lime scale accumulated in kettles as the water was boiled and later found its way into the freshly brewed tea The phlegmatic British typically took a teaspoon and went fishing to capture the offputting lime scale before drinking home brewed tea To the kettle industry the water issue was not its problem It was the problem of another industrythe public water supply By thinking in terms of solving the major pain points in customers total solution Philips saw the water problem as its opportunity The result Philips created a kettle having a mouth filter that effectively captured the lime scale as the water was poured Lime scale would never again be found swimming in British homebrewed tea The industry was again kickstarted on a strong growth trajectory as people began replacing their old kettles with the new filtered kettles There are many other examples of companies that have followed this path to create a blue ocean Just think of Dyson which designs its vacuum cleaners to eliminate the cost and annoyance of having to buy and change vacuum cleaner bags Dyson entered the US vacuum cleaner market in 2002 Back then the total size of the vacuum cleaner market in the United States was around 4 billion Market leaders including Hoover Electrolux and Oreck made modest money on the sale of their basic units which typically sold for between 75 and 125 However by eliminating vacuum cleaner bags and all the cost and hassle of buying new bags for the life of the vacuum Dyson leapfrogged the competition grew the industry and was able to sell its vacuums for nearly triple the price of the rest of the industry What is the context in which your product or service is used What happens before during and after Can you identify the pain points How can you eliminate these pain points through a complementary product or service offering Path 5 Look Across Functional or Emotional Appeal to Buyers Competition in an industry tends to converge not only on an accepted notion of the scope of its products and services but also on one of two possible bases of appeal Some industries compete principally on price and function largely on calculations of utility their appeal is rational Other industries compete largely on feelings their appeal is emotional Yet the appeal of most products or services is rarely intrinsically one or the other Rather it is usually a result of the way companies have competed in the past which has unconsciously educated consumers on what to expect Companies behavior affects buyers expectations in a reinforcing cycle Over time functionally oriented industries become more functionally oriented emotionally oriented industries become more emotionally oriented No wonder market research rarely reveals new insights into what attracts customers Industries have trained customers on what to expect When surveyed they echo back more of the same for less When companies are willing to challenge the functionalemotional orientation of their industry they often find new market space We have observed two common patterns Emotionally oriented industries offer many extras that add price without enhancing functionality Stripping away those extras may create a fundamentally simpler lowerpriced lowercost business model that customers would welcome Conversely functionally oriented industries can often infuse commodity products with new life by adding a dose of emotion and in so doing can stimulate new demand Two wellknown examples are Swatch which transformed the functionally driven budget watch industry into an emotionally driven fashion statement or The Body Shop which did the reverse transforming the emotionally driven industry of cosmetics into a functional nononsense cosmetics house In addition consider the experience of QB Quick Beauty House QB House created a blue ocean in the Japanese barbershop industry and is rapidly growing throughout Asia Started in 1996 in Tokyo QB House blossomed from one outlet in 1996 to more than two hundred shops in 2003 The number of visitors surged from 57000 in 1996 to 35 million annually in 2002 Today QB House has 463 franchise outlets in Japan and 79 franchise outlets in Hong Kong Singapore and Taiwan At the heart of QB Houses blue ocean strategy is a shift in the Asian barbershop industry from an emotional industry to a highly functional one In Japan the time it takes to get a mans haircut hovers around one hour Why A long process of activities is undertaken to make the haircutting experience a ritual Numerous hot towels are applied shoulders are rubbed and massaged customers are served tea and coffee and the barber follows a ritual in cutting hair including special hair and skin treatments such as blow drying and shaving The result is that the actual time spent cutting hair is a fraction of the total time Moreover these actions create a long queue for other potential customers The price of this haircutting process is 3000 to 5000 yen 27 to 45 QB House changed all that It recognized that many people especially working professionals do not wish to waste an hour on a haircut So QB House stripped away the emotional service elements of hot towels shoulder rubs and tea and coffee It also dramatically reduced special hair treatments and focused mainly on basic cuts QB House then went one step further eliminating the traditional timeconsuming washanddry practice by creating the air wash systeman overhead hose that is pulled down to vacuum every cutoff hair This new system works much better and faster without getting the customers head wet These changes reduced the haircutting time from one hour to ten minutes Moreover outside each shop is a traffic light system that indicates when a haircut slot is available This removes waiting time uncertainty and eliminates the reservation desk In this way QB House was able to reduce the price of a haircut to 1000 yen 9 versus the industry average of 3000 to 5000 yen 2745 while raising the hourly revenue earned per barber nearly 50 percent with lower staff costs and less required retail space per barber QB House created this nononsense haircutting service with improved hygiene It introduced not only a sanitation facility set up for each chair but also a oneuse policy where every customer is provided with a new set of towel and comb To appreciate its blue ocean creation see figure 34 FIGURE 34 The strategy canvas of QB House Cemex one of the worlds largest cement producers is another company that created a blue ocean by shifting the orientation of its industrythis time in the reverse direction from functional to emotional In Mexico cement sold in retail bags to the average doityourselfer represents some 85 percent of the total cement market7 As it stood however the market was unattractive There were far more noncustomers than customers Even though most poor families owned their own land and cement was sold as a relatively inexpensive functional input material the Mexican population lived in chronic overcrowding Few families built additions and those that did took on average four to seven years to build only one additional room Why Most of families extra money was spent on village festivals quinceaeras girls fifteenyear birthday parties baptisms and weddings Contributing to these important milestone events was a chance to distinguish oneself in the community whereas not contributing would be a sign of arrogance and disrespect As a result most of Mexicos poor had insufficient and inconsistent savings to purchase building materials even though having a cement house was the stuff of dreams in Mexico Cemex conservatively estimated that this market could grow to be worth 500 million to 600 million annually if it could unlock this latent demand8 Cemexs answer to this dilemma came with its launch of the Patrimonio Hoy program which shifted the orientation of cement from a functional product to the gift of dreams When people bought cement they were on the path to building rooms of love where laughter and happiness could be sharedwhat better gift could there be At the foundation of Patrimonio Hoy was the traditional Mexican system of tandas a traditional community savings scheme In a tanda ten individuals for example contribute 100 pesos per week for ten weeks In the first week lots are drawn to see who wins the 1000 pesos 93 in each of the ten weeks All participants win the 1000 pesos one time only but when they win they receive a large amount to make a large purchase In traditional tandas the winning family would spend the windfall on an important festive or religious event such as a baptism or marriage In the Patrimonio Hoy however the supertanda is directed toward building room additions with cement Think of it as a form of wedding registry except that instead of giving for example silverware Cemex positioned cement as a loving gift At its debut the Patrimonio Hoy building materials club that Cemex set up consisted of a group of roughly seventy people contributing on average 120 pesos each week for seventy weeks The winner of the supertanda each week however did not receive the total sum in pesos but rather received the equivalent building materials to complete an entire new room Cemex complemented the winnings with the delivery of the cement to the winners home construction classes on how to effectively build rooms and a technical adviser who maintained a relationship with the participants during their project The result Patrimonio Hoy participants build their homes or additions three times faster at a lower cost than the norm in Mexico Whereas Cemexs competitors sold bags of cement Cemex was selling a dream with a business model involving innovative financing and construction knowhow Cemex went a step further throwing small festivities for the town when a room was finished and thereby reinforcing the happiness it brought to people and the tanda tradition Since the company launched this new emotional orientation of Cemex cement coupled with its funding and technical services demand for its cement soared As of 2012 the Patrimonio Hoy program benefited 19 million individuals and 380000 families For more than fifteen years CEMEX has been contributing to solving the housing shortage in underserved areas through its Patrimonio Hoy program The predictability of the quantities of cement sold through the program has also contributed to dropping Cemexs cost structure via lower inventory costs smoother production runs and guaranteed sales that lower costs of capital Social pressure makes defaults on supertanda payments rare Overall Cemex created a blue ocean of emotional cement that achieved differentiation at a low cost and has won multiple awards including the UN Programmes 2006 World Business Award in support of the UN Millennium Development Goals and the 2009 UN Habitat Award for Best Practices in Affordable Housing Solutions Similarly with its wildly successful Viagra Pfizer shifted the focus from medical treatment to lifestyle enhancement Likewise consider how Starbucks turned the coffee industry on its head by shifting its focus from commodity coffee sales to the emotional atmosphere in which customers enjoy their coffee A burst of blue ocean creation has been under way in a number of service industries but in the opposite directionmoving from an emotional to a functional orientation Relationship businesses such as insurance banking and investing have relied heavily on the emotional bond between broker and client They are ripe for change Direct Line Group a UK insurance company for example has done away with traditional brokers It reasoned that customers would not need the handholding and emotional comfort that brokers traditionally provide if the company did a better job of for example paying claims rapidly and eliminating complicated paperwork So instead of using brokers and regional branch offices Direct Line uses information technology to improve claims handling and it passes on some of the cost savings to customers in the form of lower insurance premiums For more than twenty years since its inception Direct Lines blue ocean strategic move has been winning customers and awards including that for the best most trusted and most innovative motor insurance brand in the UK In the United States The Vanguard Group in index funds and Charles Schwab in brokerage services did the same thing in the investment industry creating a blue ocean by transforming emotionally oriented businesses based on personal relationships into highperformance lowcost functional businesses Does your industry compete on functionality or emotional appeal If you compete on emotional appeal what elements can you strip out to make it functional If you compete on functionality what elements can be added to make it emotional Path 6 Look Across Time All industries are subject to external trends that affect their businesses over time Think of the rapid rise of the cloud or the global movement toward protecting the environment Looking at these trends with the right perspective can show you how to create blue ocean opportunities Most companies adapt incrementally and somewhat passively as events unfold Whether its the emergence of new technologies or major regulatory changes managers tend to focus on projecting the trend itself That is they ask in which direction a technology will evolve how it will be adopted whether it will become scalable They pace their own actions to keep up with the development of the trends theyre tracking But key insights into blue ocean strategy rarely come from projecting the trend itself Instead they arise from business insights into how the trend will change value to customers and impact the companys business model By looking across timefrom the value a market delivers today to the value it might deliver tomorrowmanagers can actively shape their future and lay claim to a new blue ocean Looking across time is perhaps more difficult than the previous approaches weve discussed but it can be made subject to the same disciplined approach Were not talking about predicting the future something that is inherently impossible Rather were talking about finding insight in trends that are observable today Three principles are critical to assessing trends across time To form the basis of a blue ocean strategy these trends must be decisive to your business they must be irreversible and they must have a clear trajectory Many trends can be observed at any one timefor example a discontinuity in technology the rise of a new lifestyle or a change in regulatory or social environments But usually only one or two will have a decisive impact on any particular business Having identified a trend of this nature you can then look across time and ask yourself what the market would look like if the trend were taken to its logical conclusion Working back from that vision of a blue ocean strategy you can identify what must be changed today to unlock a new blue ocean For example Apple observed the flood of illegal music file sharing that began in the late 1990s Music file sharing programs such as Napster Kazaa and LimeWire had created a network of internetsavvy music lovers freely yet illegally sharing music across the globe By 2003 more than two billion illegal music files were being traded every month While the recording industry fought to stop the cannibalization of physical CDs illegal digital music downloading continued to grow With the technology out there for anyone to digitally download music free instead of paying 19 for an average CD at the time the trend toward digital music was clear This trend was underscored by the fastgrowing demand for MP3 players that played mobile digital music such as Apples hit iPod Apple capitalized on this decisive trend with a clear trajectory by launching the iTunes online music store in 2003 In agreement with five major music companiesBMG EMI Group Sony Universal Music Group and Warner Brothers RecordsiTunes offered legal easytouse and flexible la carte song downloads At its debut iTunes allowed buyers to freely browse two hundred thousand songs listen to thirtysecond samples and download an individual song for 99 cents or an entire album for 999 By allowing people to buy individual songs and strategically pricing them far more reasonably iTunes broke a key customer annoyance factor the need to purchase an entire CD when they wanted only one or two songs on it iTunes also leapt past free downloading services providing sound quality as well as intuitive navigating searching and browsing functions To illegally download music you first had to search for the song album or artist If you were looking for a complete album you had to know the names of all the songs and their order It was rare to find a complete album to download in one location The sound quality was consistently poor because most people burn CDs at a low bit rate to save space And most of the tracks available reflected the tastes of sixteenyearolds so although theoretically there were billions of tracks available the scope was limited In contrast Apples search and browsing functions are considered the best in the business Moreover iTunes music editors included a number of added features traditionally found in music stores including iTunes essentials such as Best Hair Bands or Best Love Songs staff favorites celebrity play lists and Billboard charts And the iTunes sound quality is the highest because iTunes encoded songs in a format called AAC which offered sound quality superior to MP3s even those burned at a very high data rate Customers have been flocking to iTunes and recording companies and artists are also winning Under iTunes they receive some 70 percent of the purchase price of digitally downloaded songs at last financially benefiting from the digital downloading craze In addition at the time Apple further protected recording companies by devising copyright protection that would not inconvenience userswho had grown accustomed to the freedom of digital music in the postNapster worldbut would satisfy the music industry At its outset the iTunes Music Store allowed users to burn songs onto iPods and CDs up to seven times enough to easily satisfy music lovers but far too few times to make professional piracy an issue Today iTunes offers more than 37 million songs as well as movies TV shows books and podcasts It has now sold more than 25 billion songs with users downloading on average fifteen thousand songs per minute iTunes is estimated to account for more than 60 percent of the global digital music download market Apples iTunes has unlocked a blue ocean in digital music that it has dominated for more than a decade with the added advantage of increasing the attractiveness of its long popular iPod player As other online stores zoom in on this market the challenge for Apple will be to keep its sights on the evolving mass market and not to fall into competitive benchmarking or highend niche marketing Similarly Cisco Systems created a new market space by thinking across time trends It started with a decisive and irreversible trend that had a clear trajectory the growing demand for highspeed data exchange Cisco looked at the world as it was and concluded that the world was hampered by slow data rates and incompatible computer networks Demand was exploding as among other factors the number of internet users was doubling roughly every one hundred days So Cisco could clearly see that the problem would inevitably worsen Ciscos routers switches and other networking devices were designed to create breakthrough value for customers offering fast data exchanges in a seamless networking environment Thus Ciscos insight to create a blue ocean was as much about value innovation as it was about technology Similarly a host of other companies have created blue oceans by applying path 6 Consider how CNN created the first realtime twentyfour hour global news network based on the rising tide of globalization Or how HBOs hit show Sex and the City acted on the trend of increasingly urban and successful women who struggle to find love and marry later in life and created a blue ocean that lasted six years The show which still airs in syndication was listed as one of Time magazines The 100 Best TV Shows of AllTIME What trends have a high probability of impacting your industry are irreversible and are evolving in a clear trajectory How will these trends impact your industry Given this how can you open up unprecedented customer utility Conceiving New Market Space By thinking across conventional boundaries of competition you can see how to make conventionaltering strategic moves that reconstruct established market boundaries and create blue oceans The process of discovering and creating blue oceans is not about predicting or preempting industry trends Nor is it a trialanderror process of implementing wild new business ideas that happen to come across managers minds or intuition Rather managers are engaged in a structured process of reordering market realities in a fundamentally new way Through reconstructing existing market elements across industry and market boundaries they will be able to free themselves from headtohead competition in the red ocean Figure 35 summarizes the sixpath framework FIGURE 35 From headtohead competition to blue ocean creation We are now ready to move on to building your strategy planning process around these six paths We next look at how you reframe your strategy planning process to focus on the big picture and apply these ideas in formulating your own blue ocean strategy CHAPTER 4 Focus on the Big Picture Not the Numbers YOU NOW KNOW THE PATHS to creating blue oceans The next question is How do you align your strategic planning process to focus on the big picture and apply these ideas in drawing your companys strategy canvas to arrive at a blue ocean strategy This is no small challenge Our research reveals that most companies strategic planning process keeps them wedded to red oceans The process tends to drive companies to compete within existing market space Think of a typical strategic plan It starts with a lengthy description of current industry conditions and the competitive situation Next is a discussion of how to increase market share capture new segments or cut costs followed by an outline of numerous goals and initiatives A full budget is almost invariably attached as are lavish graphs and a surfeit of spreadsheets The process usually culminates in the preparation of a large document culled from a mishmash of data provided by people from various parts of the organization who often have conflicting agendas and poor communication In this process managers spend the majority of strategic thinking time filling in boxes and running numbers instead of thinking outside the box and developing a clear picture of how to break from the competition If you ask companies to present their proposed strategies in no more than a few slides it is not surprising that few clear or compelling strategies are articulated Its no wonder that few strategic plans lead to the creation of blue oceans or are translated into action Executives are paralyzed by the muddle Few employees deep down in the company even know what the strategy is And a closer look reveals that most plans dont contain a strategy at all but rather a smorgasbord of tactics that individually make sense but collectively dont add up to a unified clear direction that sets a company apartlet alone makes the competition irrelevant Does this sound like the strategic plans in your company This brings us to the second principle of blue ocean strategy focus on the big picture not the numbers This principle is key to mitigating the planning risk of investing lots of effort and lots of time but delivering only tactical red ocean moves Here we develop an alternative approach to the existing strategic planning process that is based not on preparing a document but on drawing a strategy canvas1 This approach consistently produces strategies that unlock the creativity of a wide range of people within an organization open companies eyes to blue oceans and are easy to understand and communicate for effective execution Focusing on the Big Picture In our research and consulting work we have found that drawing a strategy canvas not only visualizes a companys current strategic position in its marketplace but also helps it chart its future strategy By building a companys strategic planning process around a strategy canvas a company and its managers focus their main attention on the big picture rather than becoming immersed in numbers and jargon and getting caught up in operational details2 As previous chapters reveal drawing a strategy canvas does three things First it shows the strategic profile of an industry by depicting very clearly the factors and the possible future factors that affect competition among industry players Second it shows the strategic profile of current and potential competitors identifying which factors they invest in strategically Finally it shows the companys strategic profileor value curve depicting how it invests in the factors of competition and how it might invest in them in the future As discussed in chapter 2 the strategic profile with high blue ocean potential has three complementary qualities focus divergence and a compelling tagline If a companys strategic profile does not clearly reveal those qualities its strategy will likely be muddled undifferentiated and hard to communicate It is also likely to be costly to execute Drawing Your Strategy Canvas Drawing a strategy canvas is never easy Even identifying the key factors of competition is far from straightforward As you will see the final list is usually very different from the first draft Assessing to what extent your company and its competitors offer the various competitive factors is equally challenging Most managers have a strong impression of how they and their competitors fare along one or two dimensions within their own scope of responsibility but very few can see the overall dynamics of their industry The catering manager of an airline for example will be highly sensitive to how the airline compares in terms of refreshments But that focus makes consistent measurement difficult what seems to be a very big difference to the catering manager may not be important to customers who look at the complete offering Some managers will define the competitive factors according to internal benefits For example a CIO might prize the companys IT infrastructure for its data mining capacity a feature lost on most customers who are more concerned with speed and ease of use Over the past twenty years we have developed a structured process for drawing and discussing a strategy canvas that pushes a companys strategy toward a blue ocean A financial services group that well call European Financial Services EFS is one of the companies that adopted this process to develop a strategy that breaks away from the competition The resulting EFS strategy yielded a 30 percent revenue boost in its initial year The process which builds on the six paths of creating blue oceans and involves a lot of visual stimulation in order to unlock peoples creativity has four major steps see figure 41 FIGURE 41 The four steps of visualizing strategy Step 1 Visual Awakening A common mistake is to discuss changes in strategy before resolving differences of opinion about the current state of play Another problem is that executives are often reluctant to accept the need for change they may have a vested interest in the status quo or they may feel that time will eventually vindicate their previous choices Indeed when we ask executives what prompts them to seek out blue oceans and introduce change they usually say that it takes a highly determined leader or a serious crisis Fortunately weve found that asking executives to draw the value curve of their companys strategy brings home the need for change It serves as a forceful wakeup call for companies to challenge their existing strategies That was the experience at EFS which had been struggling for a long time with an illdefined and poorly communicated strategy The company was also deeply divided The top executives of EFSs regional subsidiaries bitterly resented what they saw as the arrogance of the corporate executives whose philosophy they believed was essentially nuts in the field brains in the center That conflict made it all the more difficult for EFS to come to grips with its strategic problems Yet before the firm could chart a new strategy it was essential that it reach a common understanding of its current position EFS began the strategy process by bringing together more than twenty senior managers from subsidiaries in Europe North America Asia and Australia and splitting them into two teams One team was responsible for producing a value curve depicting EFSs current strategic profile in its traditional corporate foreign exchange business relative to its competitors The other team was charged with the same task for EFSs emerging online foreign exchange business They were given ninety minutes because if EFS had a clear strategy surely it would emerge quickly It was a painful experience Both teams had heated debates about what constituted a competitive factor and what the factors were Different factors were important it seemed in different regions and even for different customer segments For example Europeans argued that in its traditional business EFS had to offer consulting services on risk management given the perceived riskaverse nature of its customers Americans however dismissed that as largely irrelevant They stressed the value of speed and ease of use Many people had pet ideas of which they were the sole champions One person in the online team argued for example that customers would be drawn in by the promise of instant confirmations of their transactionsa service no one else thought necessary This was a service no player in the industry then offered In fact in early 2000 apart from a few select companies like Amazon there were very few companies in any industry that offered automatic buyer confirmations Despite these difficulties the teams completed their assignments and presented their pictures in a general meeting of all participants Their results are shown in figures 42 and 43 The pictures clearly revealed defects in the companys strategy EFSs traditional and online value curves both demonstrated a serious lack of focus the company was investing in diverse and numerous factors in both businesses Whats more EFSs two curves were very similar to those of competitors Not surprisingly neither team could come up with a memorable tagline that was true to the teams value curve FIGURE 42 The strategy canvas of corporate foreign exchange offline FIGURE 43 The strategy canvas of corporate foreign exchange online The pictures also highlighted contradictions The online business for example had invested heavily in making the website easy to useit had even won awards for thisbut it became apparent that speed had been overlooked EFS had one of the slowest websites in the business and that might explain why such a wellregarded site did a relatively poor job of attracting customers and converting them into sales The sharpest shocks perhaps came from comparing EFSs strategy with its competitors The online group realized that its strongest competitor which weve called Clearskies had a focused original and easily communicable strategy Oneclick EZ FX Clearskies which was growing rapidly was swimming away from the red ocean Faced with direct evidence of the companys shortcomings EFSs executives could not defend what they had shown to be a weak unoriginal and poorly communicated strategy Trying to draw the strategy canvases had made a stronger case for change than any argument based on numbers and words could have done This created a strong desire in top management to seriously rethink the companys current strategy Step 2 Visual Exploration Getting the wakeup call is only the first step The next step is to send a team into the field putting managers facetoface with what they must make sense of how people use or dont use their products or services This step may seem obvious but we have found that managers often outsource this part of the strategymaking process They rely on reports that other people often at one or two removes from the world they report on have put together A company should never outsource its eyes There is simply no substitute for seeing for yourself Great artists dont paint from other peoples descriptions or even from photographs they like to see the subject for themselves The same is true for great strategists Michael Bloomberg before becoming mayor of New York City was hailed as a business visionary for his realization that the providers of financial information also needed to provide online analytics to help users make sense of the data But he would be the first to tell you that the idea should have been obvious to anyone who had ever watched traders using Reuters or Dow Jones Telerate at the time Before Bloomberg traders used paper pencil and handheld calculators to write down price quotes and figure fair market values before making buy and sell decisions a practice that cost them time and money as well as builtin possible errors Great strategic insights like this are less the product of genius than of getting into the field and challenging the boundaries of competition3 In the case of Bloomberg his insight came by switching the focus of the industry from IT purchasers to users the traders and analysts This allowed him to see what was invisible to others4 Obviously the first port of call should be the customers But you should not stop there You should also go after noncustomers5 And when the customer is not the same as the user you need to extend your observations to the users as Bloomberg did You should not only talk to these people but also watch them in action Identifying the array of complementary products and services that are consumed alongside your own may give you insight into bundling opportunities Finally you need to look at how customers might find alternative ways of fulfilling the need that your product or service satisfies For example driving is an alternative to flying so you should also examine its distinct advantages and characteristics EFS sent its managers into the field for four weeks to explore the six paths to creating blue oceans6 In this process each was to interview and observe ten people involved in corporate foreign exchange including lost customers new customers and the customers of EFSs competitors and alternatives The managers also reached outside the industrys traditional boundaries to companies that did not yet use corporate foreign exchange services but that might in the future such as internetbased companies with a global reach like Amazoncom that were just beginning to take off at the time They interviewed the end users of corporate foreign exchange services the accounting and treasury departments of companies And finally they looked at ancillary products and services that their customers usedin particular treasury management and pricing simulations The field research overturned many of the conclusions managers had reached in the first step of the strategy creation process For example account relationship managers whom nearly everyone had agreed were a key to success and on whom EFS prided itself turned out to be the companys Achilles heel Customers hated wasting time dealing with relationship managers To buyers relationship managers were seen as relationship savers because EFS failed to deliver on its promises To everyones astonishment the factor customers valued most was getting speedy confirmation of transactions which only one manager had previously suggested was important The EFS managers saw that their customers accounting department personnel spent a lot of time making phone calls to confirm that payments had been made and to check when they would be received Customers received numerous calls on the same subject and the time wasted in handling them was compounded by the necessity of making further calls to the foreign exchange provider namely EFS or a competitor EFSs teams were then sent back to the drawing board This time though they had to propose a new strategy Each team had to draw six new value curves using the six path framework explained in chapter 3 Each new value curve had to depict a strategy that would make the company stand out in its market By demanding six pictures from each team we hoped to push managers to create innovative proposals and break the boundaries of their conventional thinking For each visual strategy the teams also had to write a compelling tagline that captured the essence of the strategy and spoke directly to buyers Suggestions included Leave It to Us Make Me Smarter and Transactions in Trust A strong sense of competition developed between the two teams making the process fun imbuing it with energy and driving the teams to develop blue ocean strategies Step 3 Visual Strategy Fair After two weeks of drawing and redrawing the teams presented their strategy canvases at what we call a visual strategy fair Attendees included senior corporate executives but consisted mainly of representatives of EFSs external constituenciesthe kinds of people the managers had met with during their field trips including noncustomers customers of competitors and some of the most demanding EFS customers In two hours the teams presented all twelve curvessix by the online group and six by the offline group They were given no more than ten minutes to present each curve on the theory that any idea that takes more than ten minutes to communicate is probably too complicated to be any good The pictures were hung on the walls so that the audience could easily see them After the twelve strategies were presented each judgean invited attendeewas given five sticky notes and told to put them next to his or her favorites The judges could put all five on a single strategy if they found it that compelling The transparency and immediacy of this approach freed it from the politics that sometimes seem endemic to the strategic planning process Managers had to rely on the originality and clarity of their curves and their pitches One began for example with the line Weve got a strategy so cunning that you wont be our customers youll be our fans After the notes were posted the judges were asked to explain their picks adding another level of feedback to the strategymaking process Judges were also asked to explain why they did not vote for the other value curves As the teams synthesized the judges common likes and dislikes they realized that fully onethird of what they had thought were key competitive factors were in fact marginal to customers Another onethird either were not well articulated or had been overlooked in the visual awakening phase It was clear that the executives needed to reassess some longheld assumptions such as EFSs separation of its online and traditional businesses They also learned that buyers from all markets had a basic set of needs and expected similar services If you met those common needs customers would happily forgo everything else Regional differences became significant only when there was a problem with the basics This was news to many people who had claimed that their regions were unique Following the strategy fair the teams were finally able to complete their mission They were able to draw a value curve that was a truer likeness of the existing strategic profile than anything they had produced earlier in part because the new picture ignored the specious distinction that EFS had made between its online and offline businesses More important the managers were now in a position to draw a future strategy that would be distinctive as well as speak to a true but hidden need in the marketplace Figure 44 highlights the stark differences between the companys current and future strategies FIGURE 44 EFS Before and after As the figure shows EFSs future strategy eliminated relationship management and reduced investment in account executives who from this point on were assigned only to AAA accounts These moves dramatically reduced EFSs costs because relationship managers and account executives were the highestcost element of its business EFSs future strategy emphasized ease of use security accuracy and speed These factors would be delivered through computerization which would allow customers to input data directly instead of having to send a fax to EFS which was the industry norm at the time This action would also free up corporate dealers time a large portion of which had been spent completing paperwork and correcting errors Dealers would now be able to provide richer market commentary a key success factor And EFS would send automatic electronic confirmations to all customers It would also offer a paymenttracking service just as FedEx and UPS do for parcels The foreign exchange industry had never offered these services before Figure 45 summarizes EFSs four actions to create value innovation the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy FIGURE 45 Eliminatereduceraisecreate grid The case of EFS The new value curve exhibited the criteria of a successful strategy It displayed more focus than the previous strategy investments that were made were given a much stronger commitment than before It also stood apart from the industrys existing metoo curves and lent itself to a compelling tagline The FedEx of corporate foreign exchange easy reliable fast and trackable By collapsing its online and traditional businesses into one compelling offering EFS substantially cut the operational complexity of its business model making systematic execution far easier Step 4 Visual Communication After the future strategy is set the last step is to communicate it in a way that can be easily understood by any employee EFS distributed the one page picture showing its new and old strategic profiles so that every employee could see where the company stood and where it had to focus its efforts to create a compelling future The senior managers who participated in developing the strategy held meetings with their direct reports to walk them through the picture explaining what needed to be eliminated reduced raised and created to pursue a blue ocean Those people passed the message on to their direct reports Employees were so motivated by the clear game plan that many pinned up a version of the strategy canvas in their cubicles as a reminder of EFSs new priorities and the gaps that needed to be closed The new picture became a reference point for all investment decisions Only those ideas that would help EFS move from the old to the new value curve were given the goahead When for example regional offices requested that the IT department add links on the websitesomething that in the past would have been agreed to without debateIT asked them to explain how the new links helped move EFS toward its new profile If the regional offices couldnt provide an explanation the request was denied thereby promoting clarity and not confusion on the website Similarly when the IT department pitched a multimilliondollar backoffice system to top management the systems ability to meet the new value curves strategic needs was the chief metric by which it was judged Visualizing Strategy at the Corporate Level Visualizing strategy can also greatly inform the dialogue among individual business units and the corporate center in transforming a companys business portfolio from red to blue When business units present their strategy canvases to one another they deepen their understanding of the other businesses in the corporate portfolio Moreover the process also fosters the transfer of strategic best practices across units Using the Strategy Canvas To see how this works consider how Samsung Electronics of Korea used strategy canvases Lets zoom in on one of its corporate conferences for example that was attended by more than seventy top managers including the CEO Here unit heads presented their canvases and implementation plans to senior executives and to one another Discussions were heated and a number of unit heads argued that the freedom of their units to form future strategies was constrained by the degree of competition they faced Poor performers felt that they had little choice but to match their competitors offerings That hypothesis proved to be false when one of the fastest growing unitsthe mobile phone businesspresented its strategy canvas Not only did the unit have a distinctive value curve but it also faced the most intense competition Samsung Electronics institutionalized the use of the strategy canvas in its key business creation decisions by establishing the Value Innovation Program VIP Center all the way back in 1998 Samsung was at a crossroads at the time With the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis still being felt the company under the direction of its leader Jong Yong Yun saw the dire need to break out of commoditytype competition and create products and businesses that were both differentiated and lower cost Only that CEO Yun felt would propel the company to become a leading consumer electronics company of the future With this aim the VIP Center was established under the influence of our value innovation theory7 The center is a fivestory building nestled amid the companys enormous industrial complex in Suwon South Korea Here core crossfunctional team members of its various business units come together to discuss their strategic projects with code names like Rainbow and Habana8 These discussions typically focus on strategy canvases More than two thousand people a year have been known to cycle through its VIP Center in Suwon where designers engineers planners and programmers gather for daysor monthsto hammer out detailed specifications for new products that will launch the companys products toward the blue ocean The center has a core team of members who work to support the projects passing through the center all focused on driving value innovation into Samsungs nextgeneration products With the value innovation knowledge it has developed the center equipped with twenty project rooms assists the units in making their product and service offering decisions On average some ninety strategic projects pass through the center each year Samsung also opened more than ten VIP branches to meet business units rising demands In this spirit Samsung Electronics has established an annual Value Innovation corporate conference presided over by all of its top executives At this conference Samsungs hit Value Innovation projects are shared through presentations and exhibitions and awards are given to the best cases This is one way that Samsung Electronics establishes a common language system instilling a corporate culture and strategic norms that drive its corporate business portfolio from red to blue oceans9 Samsung Electronics has come a long way since the VIP Center was established Its sales have grown from 166 billion in 1998 to 2167 billion in 2013 and its brand value has catapulted with it Samsung Electronics is now ranked as one of the topten most valuable global brands10 While Samsungs focus on driving value innovation has contributed to its sales brand value and market leadership it will need an even stronger value innovation push in the future as new lowercost rivals and untraditional players enter the fastmoving hightech consumer electronics industry Do your business unit heads lack an understanding of the other businesses in your corporate portfolio Are your strategic best practices poorly communicated across your business units Are your lowperforming units quick to blame their competitive situations for their results If the answer to any of these questions is yes try drawing and then sharing the strategy canvases of your business units Using the PioneerMigratorSettler PMS Map Visualizing strategy can also help managers responsible for corporate strategy predict and plan the companys future growth and profit All the companies that created blue oceans in our study have been pioneers in their industries not necessarily in developing new technologies but in pushing the value they offer customers to new frontiers Extending the pioneer metaphor can provide a useful way of talking about the growth potential of current and future businesses A companys pioneers are the businesses that offer unprecedented value These are your blue ocean offerings and they are the most powerful sources of profitable growth These businesses have a mass following of customers Their value curve diverges from the competition on the strategy canvas At the other extreme are settlersbusinesses whose value curves conform to the basic shape of the industrys These are metoo businesses Settlers will not generally contribute much to a companys future growth They are stuck within the red ocean The potential of migrators lies somewhere in between Such businesses extend the industrys curve by giving customers more for less but they dont alter its basic shape These businesses offer improved value but not innovative value These are businesses whose strategies fall on the margin between red oceans and blue oceans A useful exercise for a corporate management team pursuing profitable growth is to plot the companys current and planned portfolios on a pioneer migratorsettler PMS map For the purpose of the exercise settlers are defined as metoo businesses migrators are business offerings better than most in the marketplace and pioneers are your value innovation offerings If both the current portfolio and the planned offerings consist mainly of settlers the company has a low growth trajectory is largely confined to red oceans and needs to push for value innovation Although the company might be profitable today as its settlers are still making money it may well have fallen into the trap of competitive benchmarking imitation and intense price competition If current and planned offerings consist of a lot of migrators reasonable growth can be expected But the company is not exploiting its potential for growth and it risks being marginalized by a company that valueinnovates In our experience the more an industry is populated by settlers the greater is the opportunity to valueinnovate and create a blue ocean of new market space This exercise is especially valuable for managers who want to see beyond todays performance Revenue profitability market share and customer satisfaction are all measures of a companys current position Contrary to what conventional strategic thinking suggests those measures cannot point the way to the future changes in the environment are too rapid Todays market share is a reflection of how well a business has performed historically Think of the strategic reversal and market share upset that occurred when CNN entered the US news market ABC CBS and NBC all with historically strong market shareswere devastated Chief executives should instead use value and innovation as the important parameters for managing their portfolio of businesses They should use innovation because without it companies are stuck in the trap of competitive improvements They should use value because innovative ideas will be profitable only if they are linked to what buyers are willing to pay for Clearly what senior executives should be doing is getting their organizations to shift the balance of their future portfolio toward pioneers That is the path to profitable growth The PMS map shown in figure 46 depicts this trajectory showing the scatter plot of a companys portfolio of businesses where the gravity of its current portfolio of twelve businesses expressed as twelve dots shifts from a preponderance of settlers to a stronger balance of migrators and pioneers In pushing their businesses toward pioneers however senior executives should be well aware that even though settlers have marginal growth potential they are frequently todays cash generators How can senior executives then balance between cash flow and growth at a given point in time to maximize profitable growth at the corporate level What would be their best renewal strategy for their portfolio of businesses over time How would such a renewal strategy work in action We address these important questions on renewal in chapter 10 FIGURE 46 Testing the growth potential of a portfolio of businesses Overcoming the Limitations of Strategic Planning Managers often express discontent either explicitly or implicitly with existing strategic planningthe core activity of strategy To them strategic planning should be more about collective wisdom building than topdown or bottomup planning They think that it should be more conversational than solely documentationdriven and it should be more about building the big picture than about numbercrunching exercises It should have a creative component instead of being strictly analysisdriven and it should be more motivational invoking willing commitment than bargaining driven producing negotiated commitment Despite this appetite for change however scant work exists on building a viable alternative to existing strategic planning which is the most essential management task in the sense that almost every company in the world not only does it but often takes several grueling months each year to complete the exercise Put differently while companies have a clear process to create plans as of yet there has been no theory or process for true strategy creation We believe the fourstep process proposed here goes a long way to correct this situation By being built around a picture it addresses many of managers discontents with existing strategic planning and yields much better results As Aristotle pointed out The soul never thinks without an image Drawing a strategy canvas and a PMS map is not of course the only part of strategy making At some stage numbers and documents must be compiled and discussed But we believe that the details will fall into place more easily if managers start with the big picture of how to break away from the competition The methods of visualizing strategy proposed here will put strategy back into strategic planning and they will greatly improve your chances of creating a blue ocean How do you maximize the size of the blue ocean you are creating The following chapter addresses that precise question CHAPTER 5 Reach Beyond Existing Demand NO COMPANY WANTS to venture beyond red oceans only to find itself in a puddle The question is How do you maximize the size of the blue ocean you are creating This brings us to the third principle of blue ocean strategy reach beyond existing demand This is a key component of achieving value innovation By aggregating the greatest demand for a new offering this approach attenuates the scale risk associated with creating a new market To achieve this companies should challenge two conventional strategy practices One is the focus on existing customers The other is the drive for finer segmentation to accommodate buyer differences Typically to grow their share of a market companies strive to retain and expand existing customers This often leads to finer segmentation and greater tailoring of offerings to better meet customer preferences The more intense the competition is the greater on average is the resulting customization of offerings As companies compete to embrace customer preferences through finer segmentation they often risk creating toosmall target markets To maximize the size of their blue oceans companies need to take a reverse course Instead of concentrating on customers they need to look to noncustomers And instead of focusing on customer differences they need to build on powerful commonalities in what buyers value That allows companies to reach beyond existing demand to unlock a new mass of customers that did not exist before Think of Callaway Golf It aggregated new demand for its offering by looking to noncustomers While the US golf industry fought to win a greater share of existing customers Callaway created a blue ocean of new demand by asking why sports enthusiasts and people in the country club set had not taken up golf as a sport By looking to why people shied away from golf it found one key commonality uniting the mass of noncustomers hitting the golf ball was perceived as too difficult The small size of the golf club head demanded enormous handeye coordination took time to master and required concentration As a result fun was sapped for novices and it took too long to get good at the sport This understanding gave Callaway insight into how to aggregate new demand for its offering The answer was Big Bertha a golf club with a large head that made it far easier to hit the golf ball Big Bertha not only converted noncustomers of the industry into customers but it also pleased existing golf customers making it a runaway bestseller across the board With the exception of pros it turned out that the mass of existing customers also had been frustrated with the difficulty of advancing their game by mastering the skills needed to hit the ball consistently The clubs large head also lessened this difficulty Interestingly however existing customers unlike noncustomers had implicitly accepted the difficulty of the game Although the mass of existing customers didnt like it they had taken for granted that that was the way the game was played Instead of registering their dissatisfaction with golf club makers they themselves accepted the responsibility to improve By looking to noncustomers and focusing on their key commonalitiesnot differences Callaway saw how to aggregate new demand and offer the mass of customers and noncustomers a leap in value The result Callaway sailed in a lucrative blue ocean that lasted nearly a decade Where is your locus of attentionon capturing a greater share of existing customers or on converting noncustomers of the industry into new demand Do you seek out key commonalities in what buyers value or do you strive to embrace customer differences through finer customization and segmentation To reach beyond existing demand think noncustomers before customers commonalities before differences and desegmentation before pursuing finer segmentation The Three Tiers of Noncustomers Although the universe of noncustomers typically offers big blue ocean opportunities few companies have keen insight into who noncustomers are and how to unlock them To convert this huge latent demand into real demand in the form of thriving new customers companies need to deepen their understanding of the universe of noncustomers There are three tiers of noncustomers that can be transformed into customers They differ in their relative distance from your market As depicted in figure 51 the first tier of noncustomers is closest to your market They sit on the edge of the market They are buyers who minimally purchase an industrys offering out of necessity but are mentally noncustomers of the industry They are waiting to jump ship and leave the industry as soon as the opportunity presents itself However if offered a leap in value not only would they stay but also their frequency of purchases would multiply unlocking enormous latent demand The second tier of noncustomers is people who refuse to use your industrys offerings These are buyers who have seen your industrys offerings as an option to fulfill their needs but have voted against them In the Callaway case for example these were sports enthusiasts especially the country club tennis set who could have chosen golf but had consciously chosen against it FIGURE 51 The three tiers of noncustomers First tier Soontobe noncustomers who are on the edge of your market waiting to jump ship Second tier Refusing noncustomers who consciously choose against your market Third tier Unexplored noncustomers who are in markets distant from yours The third tier of noncustomers is farthest from your market They are noncustomers who have never thought of your markets offerings as an option By focusing on key commonalities across these noncustomers and existing customers companies can understand how to pull them into their new market Lets look at each of the three tiers of noncustomers to understand how you can attract them and expand your blue ocean FirstTier Noncustomers These soontobe noncustomers are those who minimally use the current market offerings to get by as they search for something better Upon finding any better alternative they will eagerly jump ship In this sense they sit on the edge of the market A market becomes stagnant and develops a growth problem as the number of soontobe noncustomers increases Yet locked within these firsttier noncustomers is an ocean of untapped demand waiting to be released Consider how Pret A Manger a British fastfood chain that opened in 1986 has expanded its blue ocean by tapping into the huge latent demand of firsttier noncustomers Before Pret professionals in European city centers principally frequented restaurants for lunch Sitdown restaurants offered a nice meal and setting However the number of firsttier noncustomers was high and rising Growing concerns over the need for healthy eating gave people second thoughts about eating out in restaurants And professionals increasingly found they did not always have time for a sitdown meal Some restaurants were also too expensive for lunch on a daily basis So professionals were increasingly grabbing something on the run bringing a brown bag from home or even skipping lunch These firsttier noncustomers were in search of better solutions Although there were numerous differences across them they shared three key commonalities they wanted lunch fast they wanted it fresh and healthy and they wanted it at a reasonable price The insight gained from the commonalities across these firsttier noncustomers shed light on how Pret could unlock and aggregate untapped demand The Pret formula is simple It offers restaurantquality sandwiches made fresh every day from only the finest ingredients and it makes the food available at a speed that is faster than that of restaurants and even fast food It also delivers this in a sleek setting at reasonable prices Consider what Pret is like Walking into a Pret A Manger is like walking into a bright Art Deco studio Along the walls are clean refrigerated shelves stocked with more than thirty types of sandwiches baguettes or wraps made fresh that day in that shop from fresh ingredients delivered earlier that morning People can also choose from other freshly made items such as salads yogurt parfaits and blended juices Each store has its own kitchen and nonfresh items are made by highquality producers Even in its New York stores Prets baguettes are from France and its croissants are from Belgium And nothing is kept over to the next day Leftover food is given to homeless shelters In addition to offering fresh healthy sandwiches and other fresh food items Pret speeds up the customer ordering experience from fast foods queueorderpaywaitreceivesit down purchasing cycle to a much faster browsepick uppayleave cycle On average customers spend just ninety seconds from the time they get in line to the time they leave the shop This is made possible because Pret produces readymade sandwiches and other things at high volume with a high standardization of assembly does not make to order and does not serve its customers They serve themselves as in a supermarket Whereas sitdown restaurants have seen stagnant demand Pret has been converting the mass of soontobe noncustomers into core thriving customers who eat at Pret more often than they used to eat at restaurants Beyond this as with Callaway restaurantgoers who were content to eat lunch at restaurants also have been flocking to Pret Although restaurant lunches had been acceptable the three key commonalities of firsttier noncustomers struck a chord with these people but unlike soontobe noncustomers they had not thought to question their lunch habits The lesson noncustomers tend to offer far more insight into how to unlock and grow a blue ocean than do relatively content existing customers Today nearly thirty years on Pret A Manger continues to enjoy robust growth and sail in the blue ocean it created It is recognized to have revolutionized the British sandwich industry Pret currently has some 335 stores with annual turnover at roughly 450 million 760 million per year with stores in the United Kingdom the United States Hong Kong and France1 What are the key reasons firsttier noncustomers want to jump ship and leave your industry Look for the commonalities across their responses Focus on these and not on the differences between them You will glean insight into how to desegment buyers and unleash an ocean of latent untapped demand SecondTier Noncustomers These are refusing noncustomers people who either do not use or cannot afford to use the current market offerings because they find the offerings unacceptable or beyond their means Their needs are either dealt with by other means or ignored Harboring within refusing noncustomers however is an ocean of untapped demand waiting to be released Consider how JCDecaux a vendor of French outdoor advertising space pulled the mass of refusing noncustomers into its market Before JCDecaux created a new concept in outdoor advertising called street furniture in 1964 the outdoor advertising industry included billboards and transport advertisement Billboards typically were located on city outskirts and along roads where traffic quickly passed by transport advertisement comprised panels on buses and taxies which again people caught sight of only as they whizzed by Outdoor advertising was not a popular campaign medium for many companies because it was viewed only in a transitory way Outdoor ads were exposed to people for a very short time while they were in transit and the rate of repeat visits was low Especially for lesserknown companies such advertising media were ineffective because they could not carry the comprehensive messages needed to introduce new names and products Hence many such companies refused to use such lowvalueadded outdoor advertising because it was either unacceptable or a luxury they could not afford Having thought through the key commonalities that cut across refusing noncustomers of the industry JCDecaux realized that the lack of stationary downtown locations was the key reason the industry remained unpopular and small In searching for a solution JCDecaux found that municipalities could offer stationary downtown locations such as bus stops where people tended to wait a few minutes and hence had time to read and be influenced by advertisements JCDecaux reasoned that if it could secure these locations to use for outdoor advertising it could convert secondtier noncustomers into customers This gave it the idea to provide street furniture including maintenance and upkeep free to municipalities JCDecaux figured that as long as the revenue generated from selling ad space exceeded the costs of providing and maintaining the furniture at an attractive profit margin the company would be on a trajectory of strong profitable growth Accordingly street furniture was created that would integrate advertising panels In this way JCDecaux created a breakthrough in value for secondtier noncustomers the municipalities and itself The strategy eliminated cities traditional costs associated with urban furniture In return for free products and services JCDecaux gained the exclusive right to display advertisements on the street furniture located in downtown areas By making ads available in city centers the company significantly increased the average exposure time improving the recall capabilities of this advertising medium The increase in exposure time also permitted richer contents and more complex messages Moreover as the maintainer of the urban furniture JCDecaux could help advertisers roll out their campaigns in two to three days as opposed to fifteen days of rollout time for traditional billboard campaigns In response to JCDecauxs exceptional value offering the mass of refusing noncustomers flocked to the industry and street furniture took off as a medium of advertisement By signing contracts of ten to twentyfive years with municipalities JCDecaux gained longterm exclusive rights for displaying ads with street furniture After an initial capital investment the only expenditure for JCDecaux in the subsequent years was the maintenance and renewal of the furniture The operating margin of street furniture was as high as 40 percent compared with 14 percent for billboards and 18 percent for transport advertisements The exclusive contracts and relatively high operating margins created a steady source of longterm revenue and profits With this business model JCDecaux was able to capture a leap in value for itself in return for a leap in value created for its buyers Today fifty years later JCDecaux remains the numberone global leader in the street furniturebased ad market space it created The company now has nearly five hundred thousand street furniture advertising panels in eighteen hundred cities in fortyeight countries around the world2 Whats more by looking to secondtier noncustomers and focusing on the key commonalities that turned them away from the industry JCDecaux also increased the demand for outdoor advertising by existing customers of the industry Until then existing customers had focused on what billboard locations or bus lines they could secure for what period and for how much They took for granted that those were the only options available and worked within them Again it took noncustomers to shed insight into the implicit assumptions of the industry that could be challenged and rewritten to create a leap in value for all What are the key reasons secondtier noncustomers refuse to use the products or services of your industry Look for the commonalities across their responses Focus on these and not on their differences You will glean insight into how to unleash an ocean of latent untapped demand ThirdTier Noncustomers The third tier of noncustomers is the farthest away from an industrys existing customers Typically these unexplored noncustomers have not been targeted or thought of as potential customers by any player in the industry Thats because their needs and the business opportunities associated with them have somehow always been assumed to belong to other markets It would drive many companies crazy to know how many thirdtier noncustomers they are forfeiting Just think of the longheld assumption that tooth whitening was a service provided exclusively by dentists and not by oral care consumerproduct companies Consequently oral care companies until relatively recently never looked at the needs of these noncustomers When they did they found an ocean of latent demand waiting to be tapped they also found that they had the capability to deliver safe highquality low cost tooth whitening solutions and the market exploded This potential applies to most industries Consider the US defense aerospace industry It has been argued that the inability to control aircraft costs is a key vulnerability in the longterm military strength of the United States3 Soaring costs combined with shrinking budgets concluded a 1993 Pentagon report left the military without a viable plan to replace its aging fleet of fighter aircraft4 If the military couldnt find a way to build aircraft differently military leaders worried the United States would not have enough airplanes to properly defend its interests Traditionally the Navy Marines and Air Force differed in their conceptions of the ideal fighter plane and hence each branch designed and built its own aircraft independently The Navy argued for a durable aircraft that would survive the stress of landing on carrier decks The Marines wanted an expeditionary aircraft capable of short takeoffs and landings The Air Force wanted the fastest and most sophisticated aircraft Historically these differences among the independent branches were taken for granted and the defense aerospace industry was regarded as having three distinct and separate segments The Joint Strike Fighter JSF program aimed to challenge this industry practice5 It looked to all three segments as potentially unexplored noncustomers that could be aggregated into a new market of higherperforming lowercost fighter planes Rather than accept the existing segmentation and develop products according to the differences in specifications and features demanded by each branch of the military the JSF program set out to question these differences It searched for the key commonalities across the three branches that had previously disregarded one another This process revealed that the highestcost components of the three branches aircraft were the same avionics software engines and major airframe structural components The shared use and production of these components held the promise of enormous cost reductions Moreover even though each branch had a long list of highly customized requirements most aircraft across branches performed the same missions The JSF team looked to understand how many of these highly customized features decisively influenced the branches purchase decision Interestingly the Navys answer did not hinge on a wide range of factors Instead it boiled down to two predominant factors durability and maintainability With aircraft stationed on aircraft carriers thousands of miles away from the nearest maintenance hangar the Navy wants a fighter that is easy to maintain and yet durable as a Mack truck so that it can absorb the shock of carrier landings and constant exposure to salt air Fearing that these two essential qualities would be compromised with the requirements of the Marines and the Air Force the Navy bought its aircraft separately The Marines had many differences in requirements from those of the other branches but again only two kept them from decisively avoiding joint aircraft purchases the need for short takeoff vertical landing STOVL and robust countermeasures To support troops in remote and hostile conditions the Marines need an aircraft that performs as a jet fighter and yet hovers like a helicopter And given the lowaltitude expeditionary nature of their missions the Marines want an aircraft equipped with various countermeasuresflares electronic jamming devicesto evade enemy groundtoair missiles because their planes are relatively easier targets given their short airtoground range Tasked with maintaining global air superiority the Air Force demands the fastest aircraft and superior tactical agilitythe ability to outmaneuver all current and future enemy aircraftand one equipped with stealth technology radarabsorbing materials and structures to make it less visible to radar and therefore more likely to evade enemy missiles and aircraft The other two branches aircraft lacked these factors and hence the Air Force had not considered them These findings on unexplored noncustomers made the JSF a promising project The aim was to build a single airframe in three variants that shared some 70 percent of their parts while reducing or eliminating the other factors that had been taken for granted by each branch but were in effect not critically decisive to their purchase decision see figure 52 FIGURE 52 The key competing factors of the defense aerospace industry The JSF project found that despite the wide range of key competing factors only those shaded in grey were decisive to each branchs fighter aircraft decision The JSF promised to be some onethird the cost per fighter aircraft At the same time the performance of the JSF now called the F35 promised to be superior to that of the topperforming aircraft for the three branches then the Air Forces F16 the Marines AV8B Harrier jet and the Navys F18 By focusing on the key decisive factors and dropping or reducing other factors in the three dominant domains of customizationnamely design weapons and mission customizationthe JSF program undertook offering a superior fighter plane at a lower cost It was also reckoned that aggregating demand previously divided among the three branches would further lower the cost In fall 2001 Lockheed Martin was awarded the massive 200 billion JSF contractthe largest military contract in historyover Boeing The Pentagon was confident that the program would be an unqualified success not only because the strategic profile of the F35 achieved exceptional value at lower cost but also because it had won the support of all three defense branches that counted on it to replace their aging aircraft fleets6 While the conception and prototype of the F35 were well received a project of this magnitude and complexity will always have unusual execution challenges As there are great execution lessons to be learned here we will revisit this move and discuss its execution issue separately in chapter 8 At the end of the day actual delivery of performance is a function of not only creative conception but also good execution7 Go for the Biggest Catchment There is no hardandfast rule to suggest which tier of noncustomers you should focus on and when Because the scale of blue ocean opportunities that a specific tier of noncustomers can unlock varies across time and industries you should focus on the tier that represents the biggest catchment that your organization has the capability to act on But you should also explore whether there are overlapping commonalities across all three tiers of noncustomers In that way you can expand the scope of latent demand you can unleash When that is the case you should not focus on a specific tier but instead should look across tiers The rule here is to go for the largest catchment that your organization has competence to seize The natural strategic orientation of many companies is toward retaining existing customers and seeking further segmentation opportunities This is especially true in the face of competitive pressure Although this might be a good way to gain a focused competitive advantage and increase share of the existing market space it is not likely to produce a blue ocean that expands the market and creates new demand The point here is not to argue that its wrong to focus on existing customers or segmentation but rather to challenge these existing takenforgranted strategic orientations What we suggest is that to maximize the scale of your blue ocean you should first reach beyond existing demand to noncustomers and desegmentation opportunities as you formulate future strategies If no such opportunities can be found you can then move on to further exploit differences among existing customers But in making such a strategic move you should be aware that you might end up landing in a smaller space You should also be aware that when your competitors succeed in attracting the mass of noncustomers with a value innovation move many of your existing customers may be attracted away because they too may be willing to put their differences aside to gain the offered leap in value It is not enough to maximize the size of the blue ocean you are creating You must profit from it to create a sustainable winwin outcome The next chapter shows how to build a viable business model that produces and maintains profitable growth for your blue ocean offering CHAPTER 6 Get the Strategic Sequence Right YOUVE LOOKED ACROSS PATHS to discover possible blue oceans Youve constructed a strategy canvas that clearly articulates your future blue ocean strategy And you have explored how to aggregate the largest catchment of buyers for your idea The next challenge is to build a robust business model to ensure that you make a healthy profit on your blue ocean idea This brings us to the fourth principle of blue ocean strategy get the strategic sequence right This chapter discusses the strategic sequence of fleshing out and validating blue ocean ideas to ensure their commercial viability With an understanding of the right strategic sequence and of how to assess blue ocean ideas along the key criteria in that sequence you dramatically reduce business model risk The Right Strategic Sequence As shown in figure 61 companies need to build their blue ocean strategy in the sequence of buyer utility price cost and adoption FIGURE 61 The sequence of blue ocean strategy The starting point is buyer utility Does your offering unlock exceptional utility Is there a compelling reason for the target mass of people to buy it Absent this there is no blue ocean potential to begin with Here there are only two options Park the idea or rethink it until you reach an affirmative answer When you clear the exceptional utility bar you advance to the second step setting the right strategic price Remember a company does not want to rely solely on price to create demand The key question here is this Is your offering priced to attract the mass of target buyers so that they have a compelling ability to pay for your offering If it is not they cannot buy it Nor will the offering create irresistible market buzz These first two steps address the revenue side of a companys business model They ensure that you create a leap in net buyer value where net buyer value equals the utility buyers receive minus the price they pay for it Securing the profit side brings us to the third element cost Can you produce your offering at the target cost and still earn a healthy profit margin Can you profit at the strategic pricethe price easily accessible to the mass of target buyers You should not let costs drive prices Nor should you scale down utility because high costs block your ability to profit at the strategic price When the target cost cannot be met you must either forgo the idea because the blue ocean wont be profitable or you must innovate your business model to hit the target cost The cost side of a companys business model ensures that it creates a leap in value for itself in the form of profitthat is the price of the offering minus the cost of production It is the combination of exceptional utility strategic pricing and target costing that allows companies to achieve value innovationa leap in value for both buyers and companies The last step is to address adoption hurdles What are the adoption hurdles in rolling out your idea Have you addressed these up front The formulation of blue ocean strategy is complete only when you can address adoption hurdles in the beginning to ensure the successful actualization of your idea Adoption hurdles include for example potential resistance to the idea by retailers or partners Because blue ocean strategies represent a significant departure from red oceans it is key to address adoption hurdles up front How can you assess whether your blue ocean strategy is passing through each of the four sequential steps And how can you refine your idea to pass each bar Lets address these questions starting with utility Testing for Exceptional Utility The need to assess the buyer utility of your offering may seem selfevident Yet many companies fail to deliver exceptional value because they are obsessed by the novelty of their product or service especially if new technology plays a part in it Consider Philips CDi an engineering marvel that failed to offer people a compelling reason to buy it The player was promoted as the Imagination Machine because of its diverse functions CDi was a video machine music system game player and teaching tool all wrapped into one Yet it did so many different tasks without an easy or intuitive user interface that people could not understand how to use it without a significant investment of time and complicated manuals In addition it lacked attractive software titles So even though the CDi theoretically could do almost anything in reality it could do very little Customers lacked a compelling reason and ability to use it and sales never took off Managers responsible for Philips CDi as well as Motorolas Iridium fell into the same trap they reveled in the bells and whistles of their new technology They acted on the assumption that bleedingedge technology is equivalent to bleedingedge utility for buyerssomething that our research found is rarely the case The technology trap that snagged Philips and Motorola trips up the best and brightest companies time and again Unless the technology makes buyers lives dramatically simpler more convenient more productive less risky or more fun and fashionable it will not attract the masses no matter how many awards it wins Value innovation is not the same as technology innovation To get around this trap the starting point as articulated in chapter 2 is to create a strategic profile that passes the initial litmus test of being focused being divergent and having a compelling tagline that speaks to buyers Having done this companies are ready to expressly assess where and how the new product or service will change the lives of its buyers Such a difference in perspective is important because it means that the way a product or service is developed becomes less a function of its technical possibilities and more a function of its utility to buyers The buyer utility map helps managers look at this issue from the right perspective see figure 62 It outlines all the levers companies can pull to deliver exceptional utility to buyers as well as the various experiences buyers can have with a product or service This map allows managers to identify the full range of utility spaces that a product or service can potentially fill Lets look at the maps dimensions in detail FIGURE 62 The buyer utility map The Six Stages of the Buyer Experience Cycle A buyers experience can usually be broken into a cycle of six stages running more or less sequentially from purchase to disposal Each stage encompasses a wide variety of specific experiences Purchasing for example may include the experience of browsing eBay as well as the aisles of The Home Depot At each stage managers can ask a set of questions to gauge the quality of buyers experience as described in figure 63 The Six Utility Levers Cutting across the stages of the buyers experience are what we call utility levers the ways in which companies can unlock exceptional utility for buyers Most of the levers are obvious Simplicity fun and image and environmental friendliness need little explanation Nor does the idea that a product might reduce a customers financial physical or credibility risks And a product or service offers convenience simply by being easy to obtain use or dispose of The most commonly used lever is that of customer productivity in which an offering helps a customer do things faster or better To test for exceptional utility companies should check whether their offering has removed the greatest blocks to utility across the entire buyer experience cycle for customers and noncustomers The greatest blocks to utility often represent the greatest and most pressing opportunities to unlock exceptional value Figure 64 shows how a company can identify the most compelling hot spots to unlock exceptional utility By locating your proposed offering on the thirtysix spaces of the buyer utility map you can clearly see how and whether the new idea not only creates a different utility proposition from existing offerings but also removes the biggest blocks to utility that stand in the way of converting noncustomers into customers If your offering falls on the same space or spaces as those of other players chances are it is not a blue ocean offering FIGURE 63 The buyer experience cycle FIGURE 64 Uncovering the blocks to buyer utility Consider the Ford Model T Before its debut the more than five hundred automakers in the United States focused on building custommade luxury autos for the wealthy In terms of the buyer utility map the entire industry focused on image in the use phase creating luxury cars for fashionable weekend outings Only one of the thirtysix utility spaces was occupied The greatest blocks to utility for the mass of people however were not in refining the autos luxury or stylish image Rather they had to do with two other factors One was convenience in the use phase The bumpy and muddy dirt roads that prevailed at the centurys start were a natural for horses to tread over but often prevented finely crafted autos from passing This significantly limited where and when cars could travel driving on rainy and snowy days was ill advised making the use of the car limited and inconvenient The second block to utility was risk in the maintenance phase The cars being finely crafted and having multiple options often broke down requiring experts to fix them and experts were expensive and in short supply In one fell swoop Fords Model T eliminated these two utility blocks The Model T was called the car for the great multitude It came in only one color black and one model with scant options In this way Ford eliminated investments in image in the use phase Instead of creating cars for weekends in the countrysidea luxury few could justifyFords Model T was made for everyday use It was reliable It was durable it was designed to travel effortlessly over dirt roads and in rain sleet or shine It was easy to fix and use People could learn to drive it in one day In this way the buyer utility map highlights the differences between ideas that genuinely create new and exceptional utility and those that are essentially revisions of existing offerings or technological breakthroughs not linked to value The aim is to check whether your offering passes the exceptional utility test as did the Model T By applying this diagnostic you can find out how your idea needs to be refined Where are the greatest blocks to utility across the buyer experience cycle for your customers and noncustomers Does your offering effectively eliminate these blocks If it does not chances are your offering is innovation for innovations sake or a revision of existing offerings When a companys offering passes this test the company is ready to move to the next step From Exceptional Utility to Strategic Pricing To secure a strong revenue stream for your offering you must set the right strategic price This step ensures that buyers not only will want to buy your offering but also will have a compelling ability to pay for it Many companies take a reverse course first testing the waters of a new product or service by targeting noveltyseeking priceinsensitive customers at the launch of a new business idea only over time do they drop prices to attract mainstream buyers It is increasingly important however to know from the start what price will quickly capture the mass of target buyers There are two reasons for this change First companies are discovering that volume generates higher returns than it used to As the nature of goods becomes more knowledge intensive companies bear much more of their costs in product development than in manufacturing This is easy to understand in the software industry While producing Apples iOS software for example cost Apple billions once produced it could be installed in an infinite number of computers for a nearly trivial cost to Apple This makes volume key A second reason is that to a buyer the value of a product or service may be closely tied to the total number of people using it A classic example is the online auction service managed by eBay where the more people who use it the more attractive the site becomes to both the sellers and buyers of goods As a result of this phenomenon called network externalities many products and services are increasingly an allornothing proposition either you sell millions at once or you sell nothing at all1 In the meantime the rise of knowledgeintensive products also creates the potential for free riding This relates to the nonrival and partially excludable nature of knowledge2 The use of a rival good by one firm precludes its use by another So for example Nobel Prizewinning scientists who are fully employed by IBM cannot simultaneously be employed by another company Nor can scrap steel consumed by Nucor be simultaneously consumed for production by other minimill steelmakers In contrast the use of a nonrival good by one firm does not limit its use by another Ideas fall into this category So for example when Virgin Atlantic Airways launched its Upper Class brandwhich for the first time essentially combined the huge seats and legroom of traditional first class with the price of businessclass ticketsother airlines were free to apply this idea to their own businessclass service without limiting Virgins ability to use it This makes competitive imitation not only possible but less costly The cost and risk of developing an innovative idea are borne by the initiator not the follower This challenge is exacerbated when the notion of excludability is considered Excludability is a function both of the nature of the good and of the legal system A good is excludable if the company can prevent others from using it because of for example limited access or patent protection Intel for example can exclude other semiconductor chipmakers from using its manufacturing facilities through property ownership laws The Asian barbershop QB House however cannot exclude someone from walking into any of its shops studying its layout atmosphere and haircutting routine and mimicking its innovative barbershop concept Once ideas are out there knowledge naturally spills over to other firms This lack of excludability reinforces the risk of freeriding Like the creative concepts of Pret A Manger or JCDecaux many of the most powerful blue ocean ideas have tremendous value but in themselves consist of no new technological discoveries As a result they are neither patentable nor excludable and hence are vulnerable to imitation All this means that the strategic price you set for your offering must not only attract buyers in large numbers but also help you to retain them Given the high potential for free riding an offerings reputation must be earned on day one because brand building increasingly relies heavily on wordof mouth recommendations spreading rapidly through our networked society Companies must therefore start with an offer that buyers cant refuse and must keep it that way to discourage any freeriding imitations This is what makes strategic pricing key Strategic pricing addresses this question Is your offering priced to attract the mass of target buyers from the start so that they have a compelling ability to pay for it When exceptional utility is combined with strategic pricing imitation is discouraged We have developed a tool called the price corridor of the target mass to help managers find the right price for an irresistible offer which by the way isnt necessarily the lower price The tool involves two distinct but interrelated steps see figure 65 FIGURE 65 The price corridor of the target mass Step 1 Identify the Price Corridor of the Target Mass In setting a price all companies look first at the products and services that most closely resemble their idea in terms of form Typically they look at other products and services within their industries Thats still a necessary exercise of course but it is not sufficient to attract new customers So the main challenge in determining a strategic price is to understand the price sensitivities of those people who will be comparing the new product or service with a host of very differentlooking products and services offered outside the group of traditional competitors A good way to look outside industry boundaries is to list products and services that fall into two categories those that take different forms but perform the same function and those that take different forms and functions but share the same overarching objective Different form same function Many companies that create blue oceans attract customers from other industries who use a product or service that performs the same function or bears the same core utility as the new one but takes a very different physical form In the case of Fords Model T Ford looked to the horsedrawn carriage The horsedrawn carriage had the same core utility as the car transportation for individuals and families But it had a very different form a live animal versus a machine Ford effectively converted the majority of noncustomers of the auto industry namely customers of horsedrawn carriages into customers of its own blue ocean by pricing its Model T against horsedrawn carriages and not the cars of other automakers In the case of the school lunch catering industry raising this question led to an interesting insight Suddenly those parents who make their childrens lunches came into the equation For many children parents had the same function making their childs lunch But they had a very different form mom or dad versus a lunch line in the cafeteria Different form and function same objective Some companies lure customers from even further away Cirque du Soleil for example has diverted customers from a wide range of evening activities Its growth came in part through drawing people away from other activities that differed in both form and function For example bars and restaurants have few physical features in common with a circus They also serve a distinct function by providing conversational and gastronomical pleasure a very different experience from the visual entertainment that a circus offers Yet despite these differences in form and function people have the same objective in undertaking these three activities to enjoy a night out Listing the groups of alternative products and services allows managers to see the full range of buyers they can poach from other industries as well as from nonindustries such as parents for the school lunch catering industry or the noble pencil in managing household finances for the personal finance software industry Having done this managers should then graphically plot the price and volume of these alternatives as shown in figure 65 This approach provides a straightforward way to identify where the mass of target buyers is and what prices these buyers are prepared to pay for the products and services they currently use The price bandwidth that captures the largest groups of target buyers is the price corridor of the target mass In some cases the range is very wide For Southwest Airlines for example the price corridor of the mass covered the group of people paying on average some 400 to buy an economyclass shorthaul ticket to about 60 for the cost of going the same distance by car The key here is not to pursue pricing against the competition within an industry but rather to pursue pricing against substitutes and alternatives across industries and nonindustries Had Ford for example priced its Model T against other autos which were more than three times the price of horsedrawn carriages the market for the Model T would not have exploded Step 2 Specify a Level within the Price Corridor The second part of the tool helps managers determine how high a price they can afford to set within the corridor without inviting competition from imitation products or services That assessment depends on two principal factors First is the degree to which the product or service is protected legally through patents or copyrights Second is the degree to which the company owns some exclusive asset or core capability such as an expensive production plant or unique design competence that can block imitation Dyson the British electrical white goods company for example has been able to charge a high unit price for its bagless vacuum cleaner from the products launch in 1995 until today thanks to strong patents hardtoimitate service capabilities and a striking design Many other companies have used upperboundary strategic pricing to attract the mass of target buyers Examples include Philips Alto in the professional lighting industry the Lycra brand created by DuPont and now owned by Invista in specialty chemicals SAP in the business application software industry and Bloomberg in the financial software industry On the other hand companies with uncertain patent and asset protection should consider pricing somewhere in the middle of the corridor As for companies that have no such protection lowerboundary strategic pricing is advised In the case of Southwest Airlines because its service wasnt patentable and required no exclusive assets its ticket prices fell into the lower boundary of the corridornamely against the price of car travel Companies would be wise to pursue midto lowerboundary strategic pricing from the start if any of the following apply Their blue ocean offering has high fixed costs and marginal variable costs The attractiveness of the blue ocean offering depends heavily on network externalities The cost structure behind the blue ocean offering benefits from steep economies of scale and scope In these cases volume brings with it significant cost advantages something that makes pricing for volume even more key The price corridor of the target mass not only signals the strategic pricing zone central to pulling in an ocean of new demand but also signals how you might need to adjust your initial price estimates to achieve this When your offering passes the test of strategic pricing youre ready to move to the next step From Strategic Pricing to Target Costing Target costing the next step in the strategic sequence addresses the profit side of the business model To maximize the profit potential of a blue ocean idea a company should start with the strategic price and then deduct its desired profit margin from the price to arrive at the target cost Here price minus costing and not costplus pricing is essential if you are to arrive at a cost structure that is both profitable and hard for potential followers to match When target costing is driven by strategic pricing however it is usually aggressive Part of the challenge of meeting the target cost is addressed in building a strategic profile that has not only divergence but also focus which makes a company strip out costs Think of the cost reductions Cirque du Soleil enjoyed by eliminating animals and stars or that Ford enjoyed by making the Model T in one color and one model having few options Sometimes these reductions are sufficient to hit the cost target but often they are not Consider the cost innovations that Ford had to introduce to meet its aggressive target cost for the Model T Ford had to scrap the standard manufacturing system in which cars were handmade by skilled craftsmen from start to finish Instead Ford introduced the assembly line which replaced skilled craftsmen with ordinary unskilled laborers who worked one small task faster and more efficiently cutting the time to make a Model T from twentyone days to four days and cutting labor hours by 60 percent3 Had Ford not introduced these cost innovations it could not have met its strategic price profitably Instead of drilling down and finding ways to creatively meet the target cost as Ford did if companies give in to the tempting route of either bumping up the strategic price or cutting back on utility they are not on the path to lucrative blue waters To hit the cost target companies have three principal levers The first involves streamlining operations and introducing cost innovations from manufacturing to distribution Can the products or services raw materials be replaced by unconventional less expensive ones such as switching from metal to plastic or shifting a call center from the UK to Bangalore Can highcost lowvalueadded activities in your value chain be significantly eliminated reduced or outsourced Can the physical location of your product or service be shifted from prime real estate locations to lowercost locations as The Home Depot IKEA and Walmart have done in retail or Southwest Airlines has done by shifting from major to secondary airports Can you truncate the number of parts or steps used in production by shifting the way things are made as Ford did by introducing the assembly line Can you digitize activities to reduce costs By probing questions such as these the Swiss watch company Swatch for example was able to arrive at a cost structure some 30 percent lower than any other watch company in the world At the start Nicolas Hayek chairman of Swatch set up a project team to determine the strategic price for the Swatch At the time cheap about 75 highprecision quartz watches from Japan and Hong Kong were capturing the mass market Swatch set the price at 40 a price at which people could buy multiple Swatches as fashion accessories The low price left no profit margin for Japanese or Hong Kong based companies to copy Swatch and undercut its price Directed to sell the Swatch for that price and not a penny more the Swatch project team worked backwards to arrive at the target cost a process that involved determining the margin Swatch needed to support marketing and services and earn a profit Given the high cost of Swiss labor Swatch was able to achieve this goal only by making radical changes in the product and production methods Instead of using the more traditional metal or leather for example Swatch used plastic Swatchs engineers also drastically simplified the design of the watchs inner workings reducing the number of parts from one hundred fifty to fiftyone Finally the engineers developed new and cheaper assembly techniques for example the watch cases were sealed by ultrasonic welding instead of screws Taken together the design and manufacturing changes enabled Swatch to reduce direct labor costs from 30 percent to less than 10 percent of total costs These cost innovations produced a cost structure that was hard to beat and let Swatch profitably dominate the mass market for watches a market previously dominated by Asian manufacturers with a cheaper labor pool Beyond streamlining operations and introducing cost innovations a second lever companies can pull to meet their target cost is partnering In bringing a new product or service to market many companies mistakenly try to carry out all the production and distribution activities themselves Sometimes thats because they see the product or service as a platform for developing new capabilities Other times it is simply a matter of not considering other outside options Partnering however provides a way for companies to secure needed capabilities fast and effectively while dropping their cost structure It allows a company to leverage other companies expertise and economies of scale Partnering includes closing gaps in capabilities through making small acquisitions when doing so is faster and cheaper providing access to needed expertise that has already been mastered A large part of IKEAs ability to meet its target cost for example comes down to partnering IKEA seeks out the lowest prices for materials and production via partnering with some two thousand manufacturing companies in more than fifty countries to ensure the lowest cost and fastest production of products in its IKEA lineup of some twenty thousand items Or consider Germanbased SAP which after forty years remains the worlds leading business application software maker By partnering with Oracle at its outset SAP saved hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in development costs and got a worldclass central database namely Oracles which sat at the heart of SAPs first two blue oceans namely R2 and later R3 SAP went a step further and also partnered with leading consulting firms such as Capgemini and Accenture to gain quick access to a global sales force and implementation team at no extra cost Whereas Oracle had the fixed costs of a much smaller sales force on its balance sheet SAP leveraged Capgeminis and Accentures strong global networks to rapidly reach SAPs target customers with no cost implication to the company SAP continues to maintain a very extensive ecosystem today with partners playing a critical role in helping organizations identify purchase and implement SAP solutions Sometimes however no amount of streamlining and cost innovation or partnering will make it possible for a company to deliver its target cost This brings us to the third lever companies can use to make their desired profit margin without compromising their strategic price changing the pricing model of the industry By changing the pricing model usedand not the level of the strategic pricecompanies can often overcome this problem NetJets for example changed the pricing model of jets to timeshare to profitably deliver on its strategic price The New Jersey company follows this model to make jets accessible to a wide range of corporate customers and wealthy individuals who buy the right to use a jet for a certain amount of time rather than buy the jet itself which would have greatly truncated the demand it could have unlocked Another model is the sliceshare mutual fund managers for example bring highquality portfolio services traditionally provided by private banks to the richto the small investor by selling a sliver of the portfolio rather than its whole Freemium is yet another pricing strategy some companies are using by which a product or service typically a digital offering such as software media games or web services is provided free of charge to pull in the target mass but a premium is charged for proprietary features functionality or virtual goods By being both free and premium companies are striving to be strategically priced to capture the target mass while earning profit for the premium features those users having used the product or service will feel compelled to buy and upgrade to These are all examples of pricing innovation Remember however that what is a pricing innovation for one industry is often a standard pricing model in another industry When IBM for example exploded the tabulating market it did so by shifting the pricing model of the industry from selling to leasing to hit its strategic price while covering its cost structure Figure 66 shows how value innovation typically maximizes profit by using the foregoing three levers As the figure depicts a company begins with its strategic price from which it deducts its target profit margin to arrive at its target cost To hit the cost target that supports that profit companies have two key levers one is streamlining and cost innovations and the other is partnering When the target cost cannot be met despite all efforts to build a lowcost business model the company should turn to the third lever pricing innovation to profitably meet the strategic price Of course even when the target cost can be met pricing innovation still can be pursued When a companys offering successfully addresses the profit side of the business model the company is ready to advance to the final step in the sequence of blue ocean strategy FIGURE 66 The profit model of blue ocean strategy A business model built in the sequence of exceptional utility strategic pricing and target costing produces value innovation Unlike the practice of conventional technology innovators value innovation is based on a winwin game among buyers companies and society Appendix C The Market Dynamics of Value Innovation illustrates how such a game is played out in the market and shows the economic and social welfare implications for its stakeholders From Utility Price and Cost to Adoption Even an unbeatable business model may not be enough to guarantee the commercial success of a blue ocean idea Almost by definition it threatens the status quo and for that reason it may provoke fear and resistance among a companys three main stakeholders its employees its business partners and the general public Before plowing forward and investing in the new idea the company must first overcome such fears by educating the fearful Employees Failure to adequately address the concerns of employees about the impact of a new business idea on their work and livelihoods can be expensive When Merrill Lynchs management for example announced plans to create an online brokerage service its stock price fell by 14 percent as reports emerged of resistance and infighting within the companys large retail brokerage division Before companies go public with an idea and set out to implement it they should make a concerted effort to communicate to employees that they are aware of the threats posed by the execution of the idea Companies should work with employees to find ways of defusing the threats so that everyone in the company wins despite shifts in peoples roles responsibilities and rewards In contrast to Merrill Lynch consider Netflix which faced the difficult task of reinventing itself from a DVDbymail business to providing video streaming To achieve this transformation Netflix has put great emphasis on engaging employees on the necessity of the shift explaining what this means to them and preparing them for change including for example making sure employees understand the levers that drive the videostreaming business The results to date have been positive with the company adding new customers at a steady rate pushing Netflixs subscribers above the forty million mark for the first time in 2013 Business Partners Potentially even more damaging than employee disaffection is the resistance of partners who fear that their revenue streams or market positions are threatened by a new business idea That was the problem faced by SAP when it was developing its product AcceleratedSAP ASAP a methodology for faster and lowercost implementation of its enterprise software system ASAP brought business application software within the reach of midsized and small companies for the first time The problem was that the development of bestpractice templates for ASAP required the active cooperation of large consulting firms that were deriving substantial income from lengthy implementations of SAPs other products As a result they were not necessarily incentivized to find the fastest way to implement the companys software SAP resolved the dilemma by openly discussing the issues with its partners Its executives convinced the consulting firms that they stood to gain more business by cooperating Although ASAP would reduce implementation time for small and midsized companies consultants would gain access to a new client base that would more than compensate for some lost revenues from larger companies The new system would also offer consultants a way to respond to customers increasingly vocal concerns that business application software took too long to implement ASAPs success was a critical step on SAPs journey to provide business application software to not only large corporations but also to midsized and small organizations as well The General Public Opposition to a new business idea can also spread to the general public especially if the idea threatens established social or political norms The effects can be dire Consider Monsanto which makes genetically modified crop seeds Its intentions were initially questioned by European consumers largely because of the efforts of environmental groups such as Greenpeace Friends of the Earth and the Soil Association The attacks of these groups struck many chords in Europe which has a history of environmental concern and powerful agricultural lobbies Since then the debate on genetically modified foods has grown and spread around the globe with Monsanto often at the heart of the attacks While the issue of genetically modified foods is a large one Monsantos mistake has been to let others take charge of the debate The company should have proactively educated the environmental groups as well as the public on the potential of genetically modified seeds to lower food costs and eliminate world famine and disease through for example drought tolerance and nutrition enhancement When the products came out Monsanto should have given consumers a choice between organic and genetically modified foods by supporting the labeling of products that had genetically modified seeds as their base If Monsanto had taken these steps listened to the objections and tried to provide solutions that responded to peoples concerns like forthright mandatory labeling then instead of being vilified it might have engendered more trust by the public and even ended up being seen in a positive light as the provider of a technology that is working to help eliminate famine and disease through enhanced seeds In educating these three groups of stakeholdersyour employees your partners and the general publicthe key challenge is to engage in an open discussion about why the adoption of the new idea is necessary You need to explain its merits set clear expectations for its ramifications and describe how the company will address them Stakeholders need to know that their voices have been heard and that there will be no surprises Companies that take the trouble to have such a dialogue with stakeholders will find that it amply repays the time and effort involved For a fuller discussion of how companies can engage internal and external stakeholders see chapter 8 The Blue Ocean Idea Index Although companies should build their blue ocean strategy in the sequence of utility price cost and adoption these criteria form an integral whole to ensure commercial success The blue ocean idea BOI index provides a simple but robust test of this system view see figure 67 FIGURE 67 Blue ocean idea BOI index As shown in figure 67 had Philips CDi and Motorolas Iridium scored their ideas on the BOI index they would have seen how far they were from opening up lucrative blue oceans With respect to Philips CDi it did not create exceptional buyer utility with its offering of complex technological functions and limited software titles It was priced out of reach of the target mass of buyers and its manufacturing process was complicated and costly With its complicated design it took more than thirty minutes to explain and sell to customers something that gave no incentive for sales clerks to sell CDi in fastmoving retail Philips CDi therefore failed all four criteria on the BOI index despite the billions poured into it By assessing the business idea of the CDi against the BOI index during development Philips could have foreseen the shortcomings embedded in the idea and addressed them up front by simplifying the product and locking in partners to develop winning software titles setting a strategic price accessible to the target mass instituting priceminus costing instead of cost plus pricing and working with retail to find a simple easy way for the sales force to sell and explain the product in a few minutes Similarly Motorolas Iridium was unreasonably expensive because of high production costs It provided no attractive utility for the target mass of buyers not being usable in buildings or cars and being the size of a brick When it came to adoption Motorola overcame many regulations and secured transmission rights from numerous countries Employees partners and the society were also reasonably motivated to accept the idea But the company had a weak sales team and marketing channels in the global markets Because Motorola was not able to follow up sales leads effectively Iridium phone sets were sometimes unavailable when requested Weak utility price and cost positions plus average adoption ability indicated that the Iridium idea would be a flop In contrast to these failures consider NTT DoCoMos imode launch in Japan While most telecom operators were focused on technology races and price competition over voicebased wireless devices NTT DoCoMo the largest Japanese telecom operator launched imode to offer the internet on cell phones The imode was the worlds first smart phone to achieve mass adoption by a country Before imode regular mobile telephony in Japan had reached a high level of sophistication in terms of mobility quality of voice ease of use and hardware design However like the mobile phone industry across the globe at the time it offered few databased services such as email access to information news and games and transaction capabilities which were the killer applications of the internet world The imode service changed that It brought together the key advantages of these two alternative industriesthe cell phone industry and the internet industryand created unique and superior buyer utility The imode service offered exceptional buyer utility at a price accessible to the target mass of buyers in Japan The monthly imode subscription fee the voice and data transmission fee and the price of content were in the nonreflection strategic price zone encouraging impulse buying and reaching the masses as quickly as possible For example the monthly subscription fee for a content site was roughly the same as the price of the most popular weekly magazines Japanese regularly pick up at their train station kiosk After setting a price that was attractive to the mass of target buyers NTT DoCoMo strove to obtain the capabilities it needed to deliver the service within its cost target in order to turn a profit In achieving this end the company was never bounded by its own assets and capabilities While it focused on its traditional role as an operator to develop and maintain a high speed highcapacity network in the imode project it sought to deliver other key elements of its offering by actively partnering with handset manufacturers and information providers By creating a winwin partnership network the company aimed to meet and sustain the target cost set by its strategic price Although there are many partners and dimensions involved in its partnership network a few aspects are particularly relevant here First NTT DoCoMo regularly and persistently shared knowhow and technology with its handsetmanufacturing partners to help them stay ahead of their competitors Second the company played the role of the portal and gateway to the wireless network expanding and updating the list of imode menu sites while attracting content providers to join the imode list and create content that would boost user traffic By handling the billing for the content providers with a small commission fee for example the company offered content providers major cost savings associated with billing system development At the same time DoCoMo also obtained a growing revenue stream for itself More importantly instead of using the Wireless Markup Language WML under the WAP standard for site creation imode used cHTML an existing and already widely used language in Japan This made imode more attractive to content providers because under cHTML software engineers needed no retraining to convert their existing websites designed for the internet environment into sites for imode use and thus they incurred no additional costs NTT DoCoMo also entered into collaborative arrangements with key foreign partners such as Microsoft to reduce the total development costs and shorten the time for an effective launch Another key aspect of the imode strategy was the way the project was carried out A team specially dedicated to the project was set up and given a clear mandate and autonomy The head of the imode team selected most of the team members and engaged them in an open discussion on how to create the new market of mobile data communications making them committed to the project All this created a favorable corporate environment for the adoption of imode Moreover the winwin game the company created for its partners as well as the readiness of the Japanese general public to use database services also contributed to the successful adoption of imode The imode service passed all four criteria on the BOI index as shown earlier in figure 67 Indeed imode turned out to be an explosive success Having passed the blue ocean idea index companies are ready to shift gears from the formulation side of blue ocean strategy to its execution The question is How do you bring an organization with you to execute this strategy even though it often represents a significant departure from the past This brings us to the second part of this book and the fifth principle of blue ocean strategy overcoming key organizational hurdles the subject of our next chapter PART THREE Executing Blue Ocean Strategy CHAPTER 7 Overcome Key Organizational Hurdles ONCE A COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED a blue ocean strategy with a profitable business model it must execute it The challenge of execution exists of course for any strategy Companies like individuals often have a tough time translating thought into action whether in red or blue oceans But compared with red ocean strategy blue ocean strategy represents a significant departure from the status quo It hinges on a shift from convergence to divergence in value curves at lower costs That raises the execution bar Managers have assured us that the challenge is steep They face four hurdles One is cognitive waking employees up to the need for a strategic shift Red oceans may not be the paths to future profitable growth but they feel comfortable to people and may have even served an organization well until now so why rock the boat The second hurdle is limited resources The greater the shift in strategy the greater it is assumed are the resources needed to execute it But resources were being cut and not raised in many of the organizations we studied Third is motivation How do you motivate key players to move fast and tenaciously to carry out a break from the status quo That will take years and managers dont have that kind of time The final hurdle is politics As one manager put it In our organization you get shot down before you stand up Although all companies face different degrees of these hurdles and many may face only some subset of the four knowing how to triumph over them is key to attenuating organizational risk This brings us to the fifth principle of blue ocean strategy overcome key organizational hurdles to make blue ocean strategy happen in action To achieve this effectively however companies must abandon perceived wisdom on effecting change Conventional wisdom asserts that the greater the change the greater the resources and time you will need to bring about results Instead you need to flip conventional wisdom on its head using what we call tipping point leadership Tipping point leadership allows you to overcome these four hurdles fast and at low cost while winning employees backing in executing a break from the status quo1 Tipping Point Leadership in Action Consider the New York City Police Department NYPD which executed a blue ocean strategy in the public sector When Bill Bratton was first appointed police commissioner of New York City the odds were stacked against him to an extent few executives ever face At the time New York City was veering toward anarchy Murders were at an alltime high Muggings Mafia hits and armed robberies filled the daily headlines New Yorkers were under siege But Brattons budget was frozen Indeed after three decades of mounting crime in New York City many social scientists had concluded that it was impervious to police intervention The citizens of New York City were crying out With miserable pay dangerous working conditions long hours and little hope of advancement in a tenure promotion system morale among the NYPDs thirtysix thousand officers was at rock bottomnot to mention the debilitating effects of budget cuts dilapidated equipment and corruption In business terms the NYPD was a cashstrapped organization with thirtysix thousand employees wedded to the status quo unmotivated and underpaid a disgruntled customer baseNew York Citys citizens and rapidly declining performance as measured by the increase in crime fear and disorder Entrenched turf wars and politics topped off the cake In short leading the NYPD to execute a shift in strategy was a managerial nightmare far beyond the imaginations of most executives The competitionthe criminalswas strong and rising Yet in less than two years and without an increase in his budget Bratton turned New York City into the safest large city in the United States He broke out of the red ocean with a blue ocean policing strategy that revolutionized US policing as it was then known The organization won as profits jumped felony crime fell 39 percent murders 50 percent and theft 35 percent Customers won Gallup polls reported that public confidence in the NYPD leaped from 37 percent to 73 percent And employees won internal surveys showed job satisfaction in the NYPD reaching an alltime high As one patrolman put it We would have marched to hell and back for that guy Perhaps most impressively the changes have outlasted its leader with crime rates continuing to fall after the leaders departure implying a fundamental shift in the organizational culture and strategy of the NYPD While the current environmental and political circumstances the NYPD faces differ greatly from then Bill Bratton was reappointed police commissioner of New York in 2014 Few corporate leaders face organizational hurdles as steep as Bratton did in executing a break from the status quo And still fewer are able to orchestrate the type of performance leap that Bratton achieved under any organizational conditions let alone those as stringent as he encountered Even Jack Welch needed some ten years and tens of millions of dollars of restructuring and training to transform GE Moreover defying conventional wisdom Bratton achieved these breakthrough results in record time with scarce resources while lifting employee morale creating a winwin for all involved Nor was this Brattons first strategic reversal It was his fifth with each of the others also achieved despite his facing all four hurdles that managers consistently claim limit their ability to execute blue ocean strategy the cognitive hurdle that blinds employees from seeing that radical change is necessary the resource hurdle that is endemic in firms the motivational hurdle that discourages and demoralizes staff and the political hurdle of internal and external resistance to change see figure 71 FIGURE 71 The four organizational hurdles to strategy execution The Pivotal Lever Disproportionate Influence Factors The key to tipping point leadership is concentration not diffusion Tipping point leadership builds on the rarely exploited corporate reality that in every organization there are people acts and activities that exercise a disproportionate influence on performance Hence contrary to conventional wisdom mounting a massive challenge is not about putting forth an equally massive response where performance gains are achieved by proportional investments in time and resources Rather it is about conserving resources and cutting time by focusing on identifying and then leveraging the factors of disproportionate influence in an organization The key questions answered by tipping point leaders are as follows What factors or acts exercise a disproportionately positive influence on breaking the status quo On getting the maximum bang out of each buck of resources On motivating key players to aggressively move forward with change And on knocking down political roadblocks that often trip up even the best strategies By singlemindedly focusing on points of disproportionate influence tipping point leaders can topple the four hurdles that limit execution of blue ocean strategy They can do this fast and at low cost Let us consider how you can leverage disproportionate influence factors to tip all four hurdles to move from thought to action in the execution of blue ocean strategy Break through the Cognitive Hurdle In many turnarounds and corporate transformations the hardest battle is simply to make people aware of the need for a strategic shift and to agree on its causes Most CEOs will try to make the case for change simply by pointing to the numbers and insisting that the company set and achieve better results There are only two performance alternatives to make the performance targets or to beat them But as we all know figures can be manipulated Insisting on stretch goals encourages abuse in the budgetary process This in turn creates hostility and suspicion between the various parts of an organization Even when the numbers are not manipulated they can mislead Salespeople on commission for example are seldom sensitive to the costs of the sales they produce Whats more messages communicated through numbers seldom stick with people The case for change feels abstract and removed from the sphere of the line managers who are the very people the CEO needs to win over Those whose units are doing well feel that the criticism is not directed at them the problem is top managements Meanwhile managers of poorly performing units feel that they are being put on notice and people who are worried about personal job security are more likely to scan the job market than to try to solve the companys problems Tipping point leadership does not rely on numbers to break through the organizations cognitive hurdle To tip the cognitive hurdle fast tipping point leaders such as Bratton zoom in on the act of disproportionate influence making people see and experience harsh reality firsthand Research in neuroscience and cognitive science shows that people remember and respond most effectively to what they see and experience Seeing is believing In the realm of experience positive stimuli reinforce behavior whereas negative stimuli change attitudes and behavior Simply put if a child puts a finger in icing and tastes it the better it tastes the more the child will taste it repetitively No parental advice is needed to encourage that behavior Conversely after a child puts a finger on a burning stove he or she will never do it again After a negative experience children will change their behavior of their own accord again no parental pestering is required2 On the other hand experiences that dont involve touching seeing or feeling actual results such as being presented with an abstract sheet of numbers are shown to be nonimpactful and easily forgotten3 Tipping point leadership builds on this insight to inspire a fast change in mindset that is internally driven of peoples own accord Instead of relying on numbers to tip the cognitive hurdle they make people experience the need for change in two ways Ride the Electric Sewer To break the status quo employees must come facetoface with the worst operational problems Dont let top brass middle brass or any brass hypothesize about reality Numbers are disputable and uninspiring but coming facetoface with poor performance is shocking and inescapable but actionable This direct experience exercises a disproportionate influence on tipping peoples cognitive hurdle fast Consider this example In the 1990s the New York subway system reeked of fear so much so that it earned the epithet electric sewer Revenues were tumbling fast as citizens boycotted the system But members of the New York City Transit Police department were in denial Why Only 3 percent of the citys major crimes happened on the subway So no matter how much the public cried out their cries fell on deaf ears There was no perceived need to rethink police strategies Then Bratton was appointed chief and in a matter of weeks he orchestrated a complete break from the status quo in the mindset of the citys police How Not by force nor by arguing for numbers but by making top brass and middle brassstarting with himselfride the electric sewer day and night Until Bratton came along that had not been done Although the statistics may have told the police that the subway was safe what they now saw was what every New Yorker faced every day a subway system on the verge of anarchy Gangs of youths patrolled the cars people jumped turnstiles and the riders faced graffiti aggressive begging and winos sprawled over benches The police could no longer evade the ugly truth No one could argue that current police strategies didnt require a substantial departure from the status quoand fast Showing the worst reality to your superiors can also shift their mindset fast A similar approach works to help sensitize superiors to a leaders needs fast Yet few leaders exploit the power of this rapid wakeup call Rather they do the opposite They try to garner support based on a numbers case that lacks urgency and emotional impetus Or they try to put forth the most exemplary case of their operational excellence to garner support Although these alternatives may work neither leads to tipping superiors cognitive hurdle as fast and stunningly as showing the worst When Bratton for example was running the police division of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority MBTA the MBTA board decided to purchase small squad cars that would be cheaper to buy and to run That went against Brattons new policing strategy Instead of fighting the decision however or arguing for a larger budgetsomething that would have taken months to reevaluate and probably would have been rejected in the endBratton invited the MBTAs general manager for a tour of his unit to see the district To let the general manager see the horror he was trying to rectify Bratton picked him up in a small car just like the ones that were being ordered He jammed the seats up front to let the manager feel how little legroom a six foot cop would get and then Bratton drove over every pothole he could Bratton also put on his belt cuffs and gun for the trip so that the manager would see how little space there was for the tools of the police officers trade After two hours the general manager wanted out He told Bratton he didnt know how Bratton could stand being in such a cramped car for so long on his own never mind having a criminal in the backseat Bratton got the larger cars his new strategy demanded Meet with Disgruntled Customers To tip the cognitive hurdle not only must you get your managers out of the office to see operational horror but you also must get them to listen to their most disgruntled customers firsthand Dont rely on market surveys To what extent does your top team actively observe the market firsthand and meet with your most disgruntled customers to hear their concerns Do you ever wonder why sales dont match your confidence in your product Simply put there is no substitute for meeting and listening to dissatisfied customers directly In the late 1970s Bostons Police District 4 which housed the Symphony Hall Christian Science Mother Church and other cultural institutions was experiencing a serious surge in crime The public was increasingly intimidated residents were selling their homes and leaving thereby pushing the community into a downward spiral But even though the citizens were leaving the area in droves the police force under Brattons direction felt they were doing a fine job The performance indicators they historically used to benchmark themselves against other police departments were tip top 911 response times were down and felony crime arrests were up To solve the paradox Bratton arranged a series of town hall meetings between his officers and the neighborhood residents It didnt take long to find the gap in perceptions Although the police officers took great pride in short response times and their record in solving major crimes these efforts went unnoticed and unappreciated by citizens few felt endangered by largescale crimes What they felt victimized by and harassed by were the constant minor irritants winos panhandlers prostitutes and graffiti The town meetings led to a complete overhaul of police priorities to focus on the blue ocean strategy of broken windows4 Crime went down and the neighborhood felt safe again When you want to wake up your organization to the need for a strategic shift and a break from the status quo do you make your case with numbers Or do you get your managers employees and superiors and yourself face toface with your worst operational problems Do you get your managers to meet the market and listen to disenchanted customers holler Or do you outsource your eyes and send out market research questionnaires Jump the Resource Hurdle After people in an organization accept the need for a strategic shift and more or less agree on the contours of the new strategy most leaders are faced with the stark reality of limited resources Do they have the money to spend on the necessary changes At this point most reformist CEOs do one of two things Either they trim their ambitions and demoralize their workforce all over again or they fight for more resources from their bankers and shareholders a process that can take time and divert attention from the underlying problems Thats not to say that this approach is not necessary or worthwhile but acquiring more resources is often a long politically charged process How do you get an organization to execute a strategic shift with fewer resources Instead of focusing on getting more resources tipping point leaders concentrate on multiplying the value of the resources they have When it comes to scarce resources there are three factors of disproportionate influence that executives can leverage to dramatically free resources on the one hand and multiply the value of resources on the other These are hot spots cold spots and horse trading Hot spots are activities that have low resource input but high potential performance gains In contrast cold spots are activities that have high resource input but low performance impact In every organization hot spots and cold spots typically abound Horse trading involves trading your units excess resources in one area for another units excess resources to fill remaining resource gaps By learning to use their current resources right companies often find they can tip the resource hurdle outright What actions consume your greatest resources but have scant performance impact Conversely what activities have the greatest performance impact but are resource starved When the questions are framed in this way organizations rapidly gain insight into freeing up low return resources and redirecting them to highimpact areas In this way both lower costs and higher value are simultaneously pursued and achieved Redistribute Resources to Your Hot Spots At the New York Transit Police Brattons predecessors argued that to make the citys subways safe they had to have an officer ride every subway line and patrol every entrance and exit To increase profits lower crime would mean increasing costs police officers in multiples that were not possible given the budget The underlying logic was that increments in performance could be achieved only with proportional increments in resourcesthe same inherent logic guiding most companies view of performance gains Bratton however achieved the sharpest drop in subway crime fear and disorder in Transits history not with more police officers but with police officers targeted at hot spots His analysis revealed that although the subway system was a maze of lines and entrances and exits the vast majority of crimes occurred at only a few stations and on a few lines He also found that these hot spots were starved for police attention even though they exercised a disproportionate impact on crime performance whereas lines and stations that almost never reported criminal activity were staffed equally The solution was a complete refocusing of cops at subway hot spots to overwhelm the criminal element And crime came tumbling down while the size of the police force remained constant Similarly before Brattons arrival at the NYPD the narcotics unit worked ninetofive weekdayonly shifts and made up less than 5 percent of the departments human resources To search out resource hot spots in one of his initial meetings with the NYPDs chiefs Brattons deputy commissioner of crime strategy Jack Maple asked people around the table for their estimates of the percentage of crimes attributable to narcotics usage Most said 50 percent others 70 percent the lowest estimate was 30 percent On that basis as Maple pointed out it was hard to argue that a narcotics unit consisting of less than 5 percent of the NYPD force was not grossly understaffed Whats more it turned out that the narcotics squad largely worked Monday to Friday even though most drugs were sold over the weekend when drugrelated crimes persistently occurred Why That was the way it had always been it was the unquestioned modus operandi When these facts were presented and the hot spot identified Brattons case for a major reallocation of staff and resources within the NYPD was quickly accepted Accordingly Bratton reallocated staff and resources on the hot spot and drug crime plummeted Where did he get the resources to do this He simultaneously assessed his organizations cold spots Redirect Resources from Your Cold Spots Leaders need to free up resources by searching out cold spots Again in the subway Bratton found that one of the biggest cold spots was processing criminals in court On average it would take an officer sixteen hours to take someone downtown to process even the pettiest of crimes This was time officers were not patrolling the subway and adding value Bratton changed all that Instead of bringing criminals to the court he brought processing centers to the criminals by using bust busesroving old buses retrofitted into miniature police stations that were parked outside subway stations Now instead of dragging a suspect down to the courthouse across town a police officer needed only to escort the suspect up to street level to the bus This cut processing time from sixteen hours to just one freeing more officers to patrol the subway and catch criminals Engage in Horse Trading In addition to internally refocusing the resources a unit already controls tipping point leaders skillfully trade resources they dont need for those of others that they do need Consider again the case of Bratton The chiefs of publicsector organizations know that the size of their budgets and the number of people they control are often hotly debated because publicsector resources are notoriously limited This makes chiefs of publicsector organizations unwilling to advertise excess resources let alone release them for use by other parts of the larger organization because that would risk a loss of control over those resources One result is that over time some organizations become well endowed with resources they dont need even while they are short of ones they do need On taking over as chief of the New York Transit Police Brattons general counsel and policy adviser Dean Esserman now police chief of New Haven Connecticut played a key horse trading role Esserman discovered that the Transit unit which was starved for office space had been running a fleet of unmarked cars in excess of its needs The New York Division of Parole on the other hand was short of cars but had excess office space Esserman and Bratton offered the obvious trade which was gratefully accepted by the parole officials For their part Transit unit officers were delighted to get the first floor of a prime downtown building The deal stoked Brattons credibility within the organization something that later made it easier for him to introduce more fundamental changes At the same time it marked him to his political bosses as a man who could solve problems Figure 72 illustrates how radically Bratton refocused the Transit Police departments resources to break out of the red ocean and execute its blue ocean strategy The vertical axis here shows the relative level of resource allocation and the horizontal axis shows the various elements of strategy in which the investments were made By deemphasizing or virtually eliminating some traditional features of Transit police work while increasing emphasis on the others or creating new ones Bratton achieved a dramatic shift in resource allocation FIGURE 72 The strategy canvas of Transit How Bratton refocused resources Whereas the actions of eliminating and reducing cut the costs for the organization raising certain elements or creating new ones required added investments As you can see on the strategy canvas however the overall investment of resources remained more or less constant At the same time the value to citizens went way up Eliminating the practice of widespread coverage of the subway system and replacing it with a targeted strategy on hot spots enabled the Transit police to combat subway crimes more efficiently and effectively Reducing the involvement of officers in processing arrests or cold spots and creating bust buses significantly raised the value of the police force by allowing officers to concentrate their time and attention on policing the subway Raising the level of investment in combating qualityoflife crimes rather than big crimes refocused the police resources on crimes that presented constant dangers to citizens daily lives Through these moves the New York Transit Police significantly enhanced the performance of its officers who were now largely freed from administrative hassles and assigned clear duties as to what kinds of crimes they should focus on and where to combat them Are you allocating resources based on old assumptions or do you seek out and concentrate resources on hot spots Where are your hot spots What activities have the greatest performance impact but are resource starved Where are your cold spots What activities are resource oversupplied but have scant performance impact Do you have a horse trader and what can you trade Jump the Motivational Hurdle To reach your organizations tipping point and execute blue ocean strategy you must alert employees to the need for a strategic shift and identify how it can be achieved with limited resources For a new strategy to become a movement people must not only recognize what needs to be done but they must also act on that insight in a sustained and meaningful way How can you motivate the mass of employees fast and at low cost When most business leaders want to break from the status quo and transform their organizations they issue grand strategic visions and turn to massive top down mobilization initiatives They act on the assumption that to create massive reactions proportionately massive actions are required But this is often a cumbersome expensive and timeconsuming process given the wide variety of motivational needs in most large companies And overarching strategic visions often inspire lip service instead of the intended action It would be easier to turn an aircraft carrier around in a bathtub Or is there another way Instead of diffusing change efforts widely tipping point leaders follow a reverse course and seek massive concentration They focus on three factors of disproportionate influence in motivating employees what we call kingpins fishbowl management and atomization Zoom In on Kingpins For strategic change to have real impact employees at every level must move en masse To trigger an epidemic movement of positive energy however you should not spread your efforts thin Rather you should concentrate your efforts on kingpins the key influencers in the organization These are people inside the organization who are natural leaders who are well respected and persuasive or who have an ability to unlock or block access to key resources As with kingpins in bowling when you hit them straight on all the other pins come toppling down This frees an organization from tackling everyone and yet in the end everyone is touched and changed And because in most organizations there are a relatively small number of key influencers who tend to share common problems and concerns it is relatively easy for the CEO to identify and motivate them At the NYPD for example Bratton zoomed in on the seventysix precinct heads at the time as his key influencers and kingpins Why Each precinct head directly controlled two hundred to four hundred police officers Hence galvanizing these seventysix heads would have the natural ripple effect of touching and motivating the thirtysixthousanddeep police force to embrace the new policing strategy Place Kingpins in a Fishbowl At the heart of motivating the kingpins in a sustained and meaningful way is shining a spotlight on their actions in a repeated and highly visible way This is what we refer to as fishbowl management where kingpins actions and inaction are made as transparent to others as are fish in a bowl of water By placing kingpins in a fishbowl in this way you greatly raise the stakes of inaction Light is shined on who is lagging behind and a fair stage is set for rapid change agents to shine For fishbowl management to work it must be based on transparency inclusion and fair process At the NYPD Brattons fishbowl was a biweekly crime strategy review meeting known as Compstat that brought together the citys top brass to review the performance of all seventysix precinct commanders in executing its new strategy Attendance was mandatory for all precinct commanders threestar chiefs deputy commissioners and borough chiefs were also required to attend Bratton himself was there as often as possible As each precinct commander was questioned on decreases and increases in crime performance in front of peers and superiors based on the organizations new strategic directives enormous computergenerated overhead maps and charts were shown visually illustrating in inescapable terms the commanders performance in executing the new strategy The commander was responsible for explaining the maps describing how his or her officers were addressing the issues and outlining why performance was going up or down These inclusive meetings instantly made results and responsibilities clear and transparent for everyone As a result an intense performance culture was created in weeksforget about months let alone yearsbecause no kingpin wanted to be shamed in front of others and they all wanted to shine in front of their peers and superiors In the fishbowl incompetent precinct commanders could no longer cover up their failings by blaming their precincts results on the shortcomings of neighboring precincts because their neighbors were in the room and could respond Indeed a picture of the precinct commander to be grilled at the crime strategy meetings was printed on the front page of the handout emphasizing that the commander was responsible and accountable for that precincts results By the same token the fishbowl gave an opportunity for high achievers to gain recognition for work in their own precincts and in helping others The meetings also provided an opportunity for policy leaders to compare notes on their experiences before Brattons arrival precinct commanders seldom got together as a group Over time this style of fishbowl management filtered down the ranks as the precinct commanders tried out their own versions of Brattons meetings With the spotlight shining brightly on their performance in strategy execution the precinct commanders were highly motivated to get all the officers under their control marching to the new strategy For this to work however organizations must simultaneously make fair process the modus operandi By fair process we mean engaging all the affected people in the process explaining to them the basis of decisions and the reasons people will be promoted or sidestepped in the future and setting clear expectations of what that means to employees performance At the NYPDs crime strategy review meetings no one could argue that the playing field wasnt fair The fishbowl was applied to all kingpins There was clear transparency in the assessment of every commanders performance and how it would tie into advancement or demotion and clear expectations were set in every meeting of what was expected in performance from everyone In this way fair process signals to people that there is a level playing field and that leaders value employees intellectual and emotional worth despite all the change that may be required This greatly mitigates feelings of suspicion and doubt that are almost necessarily present in employees minds when a company is trying to make a major strategic shift The cushion of support provided by fair process combined with the fishbowl emphasis on sheer performance pushes people and supports them on the journey demonstrating managers intellectual and emotional respect for employees For a fuller discussion on fair process and its motivational implications see chapter 8 Atomize to Get the Organization to Change Itself The last disproportionate influence factor is atomization Atomization relates to the framing of the strategic challengeone of the most subtle and sensitive tasks of the tipping point leader Unless people believe that the strategic challenge is attainable the change is not likely to succeed On the face of it Brattons goal in New York City was so ambitious as to be scarcely believable Who could believe that anything an individual could do would turn such a huge city from being the most dangerous place in the country into the safest And who would want to invest time and energy in chasing an impossible dream To make the challenge attainable Bratton broke it into bitesize atoms that officers at different levels could relate to As he put it the challenge facing the NYPD was to make the streets of New York City safe block by block precinct by precinct and borough by borough Thus framed the challenge was both allencompassing and doable For officers on the street the challenge was to make their beat or block safeno more For the precinct commanders the challenge was to make their precinct safeno more Borough heads also had a concrete goal within their capabilities making their boroughs safeno more No one could say that what was being asked of them was too tough Nor could they claim that achieving it was largely out of their handsIts beyond me In this way responsibility for executing Brattons blue ocean strategy shifted from him to each of the NYPDs thirtysix thousand officers Do you indiscriminately try to motivate the masses Or do you focus on key influencers your kingpins Do you put the spotlight on and manage kingpins in a fishbowl based on fair process Or do you just demand high performance and cross your fingers until the next quarter numbers come out Do you issue grand strategic visions Or do you atomize the issue to make it actionable to all levels Knock Over the Political Hurdle Youth and skill will win out every time over age and treachery True or false False Even the best and brightest are regularly eaten alive by politics intrigue and plotting Organizational politics is an inescapable reality of corporate and public life Even if an organization has reached the tipping point of execution there exist powerful vested interests that will resist the impending changes Also see our discussion on adoption hurdles in chapter 6 The more likely change becomes the more fiercely and vocally these negative influencersboth internal and externalwill fight to protect their positions and their resistance can seriously damage and even derail the strategy execution process To overcome these political forces tipping point leaders focus on three disproportionate influence factors leveraging angels silencing devils and getting a consigliere on their top management team Angels are those who have the most to gain from the strategic shift Devils are those who have the most to lose from it And a consigliere is a politically adept but highly respected insider who knows in advance all the land mines including who will fight you and who will support you Secure a Consigliere on Your Top Management Team Most leaders concentrate on building a top management team having strong functional skills such as marketing operations and financeand that is important Tipping point leaders however also engage one role few other executives think to include a consigliere To that end Bratton for example always ensured that he had a respected senior insider on his top team who knew the land mines he would face in implementing the new policing strategy At NYPD Bratton appointed John Timoney as his number two Timoney was a cops cop respected and feared for his dedication to the NYPD and for the more than sixty decorations and combat crosses he had received Twenty years in the ranks had taught him not only who all the key players were but also how they played the political game One of the first tasks Timoney did was to report to Bratton on the likely attitudes of the top staff to the NYPDs new policing strategy identifying those who would fight or silently sabotage the new initiative This led to a dramatic changing of the guard Leverage Your Angels and Silence Your Devils To knock down the political hurdles you should also ask yourself two sets of questions Who are my devils Who will fight me Who will lose the most by the future blue ocean strategy Who are my angels Who will naturally align with me Who will gain the most by the strategic shift Dont fight alone Get the higher and wider voice to fight with you Identify your detractors and supportersforget the middleand strive to create a winwin outcome for both But move quickly Isolate your detractors by building a broader coalition with your angels before a battle begins In this way you will discourage the war before it has a chance to start or gain steam One of the most serious threats to Brattons new policing strategy came from New York Citys courts Believing that Brattons new policing strategy of focusing on qualityoflife crimes would overwhelm the system with small crime cases such as prostitution and public drunkenness the courts opposed the strategic shift To overcome this opposition Bratton clearly illustrated to his supporters including the mayor district attorneys and jail managers that the court system could indeed handle the added qualityof life crimes and that focusing on them would in the long term actually reduce their caseload The mayor decided to intervene Then Brattons coalition led by the mayor went on the offensive in the press with a clear and simple message if the courts did not pull their weight the citys crime rate would not go down Brattons alliance with the mayors office and the citys leading newspaper successfully isolated the courts They could hardly be seen to publicly oppose an initiative that would not only make New York a more attractive place to live but would also ultimately reduce the number of cases brought before them With the mayor speaking aggressively in the press of the need to pursue qualityof life crimes and the citys most respectedand liberalnewspaper giving credence to the new police strategy the costs of fighting Brattons strategy were daunting Bratton had won the battle the courts would comply He also won the war crime rates did indeed come down Key to winning over your detractors or devils is knowing all their likely angles of attack and building up counterarguments backed by irrefutable facts and reason For example when the NYPDs precinct commanders were first requested to compile detailed crime data and maps they balked at the idea arguing that it would take too much time Anticipating this reaction Bratton had already done a test run of the operation to see how long it would take no more than eighteen minutes a day which worked out as he told the commanders to less than 1 percent of their average workload Armed with irrefutable information he was able to tip the political hurdle and win the battle before it even began Do you have a consiglierea highly respected insiderin your top management team or only a CFO and other functional heads Do you know who will fight you and who will align with the new strategy Have you built coalitions with natural allies to encircle dissidents Do you have your consigliere remove the biggest land mines so that you dont have to focus on changing those who cannot and will not change Challenging Conventional Wisdom Figure 73 depicts the gist of how tipping point leadership works As shown the conventional theory of organizational change rests on transforming the mass So change efforts are focused on moving the mass requiring steep resources and long time framesluxuries few executives can afford Tipping point leadership by contrast takes a reverse course To change the mass it focuses on transforming the extremes the people acts and activities that exercise a disproportionate influence on performance By transforming the extremes tipping point leaders are able to change the core fast and at low cost to execute their new strategy FIGURE 73 Conventional wisdom versus tipping point leadership It is never easy to execute a strategic shift and doing it fast with limited resources is even more difficult Yet our research suggests that it can be achieved by leveraging tipping point leadership By consciously addressing the hurdles to strategy execution and focusing on factors of disproportionate influence you too can knock them over to actualize a strategic shift Dont follow conventional wisdom Not every challenge requires a proportionate action Focus on acts of disproportionate influence This is a critical leadership component for making blue ocean strategy happen The next chapter drills down one level further It addresses the challenge of mobilizing peoples minds and hearts for the new strategy by building a culture of trust commitment and voluntary cooperation in its execution as well as support for the leader CHAPTER 8 Build Execution into Strategy A COMPANY IS NOT ONLY TOP MANAGEMENT nor is it only middle management A company is everyone from the top to the front lines And it is only when all the members of an organization are motivated to support a strategy for better or for worse that a company stands apart as a great and consistent executor Overcoming the organizational hurdles to strategy execution is an important step toward that end It removes the roadblocks that can put a halt to even the best of strategies But in the end a company needs to invoke the most fundamental base of action the attitudes and behavior of its people deep in the organization You must create a culture of trust and commitment that motivates people to execute the agreed strategynot to the letter but to the spirit Peoples minds and hearts must align with the new strategy so that at the level of the individual people embrace it of their own accord and willingly go beyond compulsory execution to voluntary cooperation in carrying it out Where blue ocean strategy is concerned this challenge is heightened Trepidation builds as people are required to step out of their comfort zones and change how they have worked in the past They wonder what are the real reasons for this change Is top management honest when it speaks of building future growth through a change in strategic course Or are they trying to make us redundant and work us out of our jobs The more removed people are from the top and the less they have been involved in the creation of the strategy the more this trepidation builds On the front line at the very level at which a strategy must be executed day in and day out people can resent having a strategy thrust upon them with little regard for what they think and feel Just when you think you have done everything right things can suddenly go very wrong on your front line This brings us to the sixth principle of blue ocean strategy to build peoples trust and commitment deep in the ranks and inspire their voluntary cooperation companies need to build execution into strategy from the start That principle allows companies to minimize the management risk of distrust noncooperation and even sabotage This management risk is relevant to strategy execution in both red and blue oceans but it is greater for blue ocean strategy because its execution often requires significant change Hence minimizing such risk is essential as companies execute blue ocean strategy Companies must reach beyond the usual suspects of carrots and sticks They must reach to fair process in the making and executing of strategy Our research shows that fair process is a key variable that distinguishes successful blue ocean strategic moves from those that failed The presence or absence of fair process can make or break a companys best execution efforts Poor Process Can Ruin Strategy Execution Consider the experience of a global leader in supplying waterbased liquid coolants for metalworking industries Well call this organization Lubber Because of the many processing parameters in metalbased manufacturing there are several hundred complex types of coolants to choose from Choosing the right coolant is a delicate process Products must first be tested on production machines before purchasing and the decision often rests on fuzzy logic The result is machine downtime and sampling costs and these are expensive for customers and Lubber alike To offer customers a leap in value Lubber devised a strategy to eliminate the complexity and costs of the trial phase Using artificial intelligence it developed an expert system that cut the failure rate in selecting coolants to less than 10 percent from an industry average of 50 percent The system also reduced machine downtime eased coolant management and raised the overall quality of work pieces produced As for Lubber the sales process was dramatically simplified giving sales representatives more time to gain new sales and dropping the costs per sale This winwin value innovation strategic move however was doomed from the start It wasnt that the strategy was not good or that the expert system did not work it worked exceptionally well The strategy was doomed because the sales force fought it Having not been engaged in the strategymaking process nor apprised of the rationale for the strategic shift sales reps saw the expert system in a light no one on the design team or management team had ever imagined To them it was a direct threat to what they saw as their most valuable contributiontinkering in the trial phase to find the right waterbased coolant from the long list of possible candidates All the wonderful benefits having a way to avoid the hasslefilled part of their job having more time to pull in more sales and winning more contracts by standing out in the industrywent unappreciated With the sales force feeling threatened and often working against the expert system by expressing doubts about its effectiveness to customers sales did not take off After cursing its hubris and learning the hard way the importance of dealing with managerial risk up front based on the proper process management was forced to pull the expert system from the market and work on rebuilding trust with its sales representatives The Power of Fair Process What then is fair process And how does it allow companies to build execution into strategy The theme of fairness or justice has preoccupied writers and philosophers throughout the ages But the direct theoretical origin of fair process traces back to two social scientists John W Thibaut and Laurens Walker In the mid1970s they combined their interest in the psychology of justice with the study of process creating the term procedural justice1 Focusing their attention on legal settings they sought to understand what makes people trust a legal system so that they will comply with laws without being coerced Their research established that people care as much about the justice of the process through which an outcome is produced as they do about the outcome itself Peoples satisfaction with the outcome and their commitment to it rose when procedural justice was exercised2 Fair process is our managerial expression of procedural justice theory As in legal settings fair process builds execution into strategy by creating peoples buyin up front When fair process is exercised in the strategy making process people trust that a level playing field exists This inspires them to cooperate voluntarily in executing the resulting strategic decisions Voluntary cooperation is more than mechanical execution where people do only what it takes to get by It involves going beyond the call of duty wherein individuals exert energy and initiative to the best of their abilities even subordinating personal selfinterestto execute resulting strategies3 Figure 81 presents the causal flow we observed among fair process attitudes and behavior FIGURE 81 How fair process affects peoples attitudes and behavior The Three E Principles of Fair Process There are three mutually reinforcing elements that define fair process engagement explanation and clarity of expectation4 Whether people are senior executives or shop floor employees they all look to these elements We call them the three E principles of fair process Engagement means involving individuals in the strategic decisions that affect them by asking for their input and allowing them to refute the merits of one anothers ideas and assumptions Engagement communicates managements respect for individuals and their ideas Encouraging refutation sharpens everyones thinking and builds better collective wisdom Engagement results in better strategic decisions by management and greater commitment from all involved to execute those decisions Explanation means that everyone involved and affected should understand why final strategic decisions are made as they are An explanation of the thinking that underlies decisions makes people confident that managers have considered their opinions and have made decisions impartially in the overall interests of the company An explanation allows employees to trust managers intentions even if their own ideas have been rejected It also serves as a powerful feedback loop that enhances learning Expectation clarity requires that after a strategy is set managers state clearly the new rules of the game Although the expectations may be demanding employees should know up front what standards they will be judged by and the penalties for failure What are the goals of the new strategy What are the new targets and milestones Who is responsible for what To achieve fair process it matters less what the new goals expectations and responsibilities are and more that they are clearly understood When people understand what is expected of them political jockeying and favoritism are minimized and people can focus on executing the strategy rapidly Taken together these three criteria collectively lead to judgments of fair process This is important because any subset of the three does not create judgments of fair process A Tale of Two Plants How do the three E principles of fair process work to affect strategy execution deep in an organization Consider the experience of an elevator systems manufacturer well call Elco that was in transition At the time sales in the elevator industry were in steady decline as excess office space left some large US cities with vacancy rates as high as 20 percent With domestic demand falling Elco set out to offer buyers a leap in value while lowering its costs to stimulate new demand and break from the competition In its quest to create and execute a blue ocean strategy the company realized that it needed to replace its batchmanufacturing system with a cellular approach that would allow selfdirected teams to achieve superior performance The management team was in agreement and ready to go To execute this key element of its strategy the team adopted what looked like the fastest and smartest way to move forward It would first install the new system at Elcos Chester plant and then roll it out to its second plant High Park The logic was simple The Chester plant had exemplary employee relations so much so that the workers had decertified their own union Management was certain it could count on employee cooperation to execute the strategic shift in manufacturing In the companys words They were the ideal workforce Next Elco would roll out the process to its plant in High Park where a strong union was expected to resist that or any other change Management was counting on having achieved a degree of momentum for execution at Chester that it hoped would have positive spillover effects on High Park The theory was good In practice however things took an unpredicted turn The introduction of the new manufacturing process at the Chester plant quickly led to disorder and rebellion Within a few months both cost and quality performance were in free fall Employees were talking about bringing back the union Having lost control the despairing plant manager called Elcos industrial psychologist for help In contrast the High Park plant despite its reputation for resistance had accepted the strategic shift in the manufacturing process Every day the High Park manager waited for the anticipated meltdown but it never came Even when people didnt like the decisions they felt they had been treated fairly and so they willingly participated in the rapid execution of the new manufacturing process a pivotal component of the companys new strategy A closer look at the way the strategic shift was made at the two plants reveals the reasons behind this apparent anomaly At the Chester plant Elco managers violated all three of the basic principles of fair process First they failed to engage employees in the strategic decisions that directly affected them Lacking expertise in cellular manufacturing Elco brought in a consulting firm to design a master plan for the conversion The consultants were briefed to work quickly and with minimal disturbance to employees so that fast painless implementation could be achieved The consultants followed the instructions When Chester employees arrived at work they discovered strangers at the plant who not only dressed differentlywearing formal business attirebut also spoke in low tones to one another To minimize disturbance they didnt interact with employees Instead they quietly hovered behind peoples backs taking notes and drawing diagrams The rumor circulated that after employees went home in the afternoon these same people would swarm across the plant floor snoop around peoples workstations and have heated discussions During this period the plant manager was increasingly absent He was spending more time at Elcos head office in meetings with the consultants sessions deliberately scheduled away from the plant so as not to distract the employees But the plant managers absence produced the opposite effect As people grew anxious wondering why the captain of their ship seemed to be deserting them the rumor mill moved into high gear Everyone became convinced that the consultants would downsize the plant They were sure they were about to lose their jobs The fact that the plant manager was always gone without any explanationobviously he was avoiding them could only mean that management was they thought trying to put one over on us Trust and commitment at the Chester plant deteriorated quickly Soon people were bringing in newspaper clippings about other plants around the country that had been shut down with the help of consultants Employees saw themselves as imminent victims of managements hidden intention to downsize and work people out of their jobs In fact Elco managers had no intention of closing the plant They wanted to cut waste freeing people to produce higherquality elevators faster at lower cost to leapfrog the competition But plant employees could not have known that Managers at Chester also didnt explain why strategic decisions were being made the way they were and what those decisions meant to employees careers and work methods Management unveiled the master plan for change in a thirtyminute session with employees The audience heard that their timehonored way of working would be abolished and replaced by something called cellular manufacturing No one explained why the strategic shift was needed how the company needed to break away from the competition to stimulate new demand and why the shift in the manufacturing process was a key element of that strategy Employees sat in stunned silence with no understanding of the rationale behind the change The managers mistook this for acceptance forgetting how long it had taken them over the preceding few months to get comfortable with the idea of shifting to cellular manufacturing to execute the new strategy Master plan in hand management quickly began rearranging the plant When employees asked what the new layout aimed to achieve the response was efficiency gains The managers didnt have time to explain why efficiency had to be improved and didnt want to worry employees But lacking an intellectual understanding of what was happening to them some employees began feeling sick as they came to work Managers also neglected to make clear what would be expected of employees under the new manufacturing process They informed employees that they would no longer be judged on individual performance but rather on the performance of the cell They said that faster or more experienced employees would have to pick up the slack for slower or less experienced colleagues But they didnt elaborate How the new cellular system was supposed to work managers didnt make clear Violations of the principles of fair process undermined employees trust in the strategic shift and in management In fact the new cell design offered tremendous benefits to employeesfor example making vacations easier to schedule and giving them the opportunity to broaden their skills and engage in a greater variety of work Yet employees could see only its negative side They began taking out their fear and anger on one another Fights erupted on the plant floor as employees refused to help those they called lazy people who cant finish their own jobs or interpreted offers of help as meddling responding with This is my job You keep to your own workstation Chesters model workforce was falling apart For the first time in the plant managers career employees refused to do as they were asked turning down assignments even if you fire me They felt they could no longer trust the once popular plant manager so they began to go around him taking their complaints directly to his boss at the head office In the absence of fair process the Chester plants employees rejected the transformation and refused to play their role in executing the new strategy In contrast management at the High Park plant abided by all three principles of fair process when introducing the strategic shift When the consultants came to the plant the plant manager introduced them to all employees Management engaged employees by holding a series of plantwide meetings where corporate executives openly discussed the declining business conditions and the companys need for a change in strategic course to break from the competition and simultaneously achieve higher value at lower cost They explained that they had visited other companies plants and had seen the productivity improvements that cellular manufacturing could bring They explained how this would be a pivotal determinant of the companys ability to achieve its new strategy They announced a proactiontime policy to calm employees justifiable fears of layoffs As old performance measures were discarded managers worked with employees to develop new ones and to establish each cell teams new responsibilities Goals and expectations were made clear to employees By practicing the three principles of fair process in tandem management won the understanding and support of High Park employees The employees spoke of their plant manager with admiration and they commiserated with the difficulties Elcos managers had in executing the new strategy and making the changeover to cellular manufacturing They concluded that it had been a necessary worthwhile and positive experience Elcos managers still regard this experience as one of the most painful in their careers They learned that people in the front line care as much about the proper process as those at the top By violating fair process in making and rolling out strategies managers can turn their best employees into their worst earning their distrust of and resistance to the very strategy they depend on them to execute But if managers practice fair process the worst employees can turn into the best and can execute even difficult strategic shifts with their willing commitment while building their trust Why Does Fair Process Matter Why is fair process important in shaping peoples attitudes and behavior Specifically why does the observance or violation of fair process in strategy making have the power to make or break a strategys execution It all comes down to intellectual and emotional recognition Emotionally individuals seek recognition of their value not as labor personnel or human resources but as human beings who are treated with full respect and dignity and appreciated for their individual worth regardless of hierarchical level Intellectually individuals seek recognition that their ideas are sought after and given thoughtful reflection and that others think enough of their intelligence to explain their thinking to them Such frequently cited expressions in our interviews as that goes for everyone I know or every person wants to feel and constant references to people and human beings reinforce the point that managers must see the nearly universal value of the intellectual and emotional recognition that fair process conveys Intellectual and Emotional Recognition Theory Using fair process in strategy making is strongly linked to both intellectual and emotional recognition5 It proves through action that there is an eagerness to trust and cherish the individual as well as a deepseated confidence in the individuals knowledge talents and expertise When individuals feel recognized for their intellectual worth they are willing to share their knowledge in fact they feel inspired to impress and confirm the expectation of their intellectual value suggesting active ideas and knowledge sharing6 Similarly when individuals are treated with emotional recognition they feel emotionally tied to the strategy and inspired to give their all Indeed in Frederick Herzbergs classic study on motivation recognition was found to inspire strong intrinsic motivation causing people to go beyond the call of duty and engage in voluntary cooperation7 Hence to the extent that fair process judgments convey intellectual and emotional recognition people will better apply their knowledge and expertise as well as their voluntary efforts to cooperate for the organizations success in executing strategy However there is a flip side to this that is deserving of equal if not more attention the violation of fair process and with it the violation of recognizing individuals intellectual and emotional worth The observed pattern of thought and behavior can be summarized as follows If individuals are not treated as though their knowledge is valued they will feel intellectual indignation and will not share their ideas and expertise rather they will hoard their best thinking and creative ideas preventing new insights from seeing the light of day Whats more they will reject others intellectual worth as well Its as if they were saying You dont value my ideas So I dont value your ideas nor do I trust in or care about the strategic decisions youve reached Similarly to the extent that peoples emotional worth is not recognized they will feel angry and will not invest their energy in their actions rather they will drag their feet and apply counter efforts including sabotage as in the case of Elcos Chester plant This often leads employees to push for rolling back strategies that have been imposed unfairly even when the strategies themselves were good onescritical to the companys success or beneficial to employees and managers themselves Lacking trust in the strategymaking process people lack trust in the resulting strategies Such is the emotional power that fair process can provoke When people are angered by the violation of fair process not only do they want fair process restored they also seek to punish those who violated it Theorists call this retributive justice Figure 82 shows the observed causal pattern FIGURE 82 The consequences of the presence and absence of fair process in strategy formulation and execution Fair Process and Intangible Capital of an Organization Commitment trust and voluntary cooperation are not merely attitudes or behaviors They are intangible capital When people have trust they have heightened confidence in one anothers intentions and actions When they have commitment they are even willing to override personal selfinterest in the interests of the company If you ask any company that has created and successfully executed a blue ocean strategy managers will be quick to rattle off how important this intangible capital is to their success Similarly managers from companies that have failed in executing a blue ocean strategy will point out that the lack of this capital contributed to their failure These companies were not able to orchestrate strategic shifts because they lacked peoples trust and commitment Commitment trust and voluntary cooperation allow companies to stand apart in the speed quality and consistency of their execution and to implement strategic shifts fast at low cost The question companies wrestle with is how to create trust commitment and voluntary cooperation deep in the organization You dont do it by separating strategy formulation from execution Although this disconnect may be a hallmark of most companies practice it is also a hallmark of slow and questionable implementation and mechanical followthrough at best Of course traditional incentives of power and moneycarrots and sticks help But they fall short of inspiring human behavior that goes beyond outcomedriven selfinterest Where behavior cannot be monitored with certainty there is still plenty of room for footdragging and sabotage The exercise of fair process gets around this dilemma By organizing the strategy formulation process around the principles of fair process you can build execution into strategy making from the start With fair process people tend to be committed to support the resulting strategy even when it is viewed as not favorable or at odds with their perception of what is strategically correct for their unit People realize that compromises and sacrifices are necessary in building a strong company They accept the need for shortterm personal sacrifices in order to advance the longterm interests of the corporation This acceptance is conditional however on the presence of fair process Whatever the context in which a companys blue ocean strategy is executed we have consistently observed this dynamic at work Fair Process and External Stakeholders The impact of fair process has so far been discussed largely in the context of internal stakeholders of an organization In this increasingly interdependent world however external stakeholders play a key role in many organizations success In fact compared with internal stakeholders the practice of fair process with external stakeholders could be said to play an even greater role in strategy execution as external stakeholders are outside of hierarchical control and often have diverging interests and understandings While contracts and their enforceability with external partners are important the information asymmetry that exists across organizations coupled with the natural tendency for their interests and understandings to differ make fair process central Without external stakeholders commitment and cooperation execution can easily become a slippery slope of missed deadlines halfhearted alignment on quality and cost overruns The larger and more complex the nature of reliance on external stakeholders is the more this is likely to occur Think of the F35 program discussed in chapter 5 The F35 represented a conceptual breakthrough in fighter aircraft design that promised a blue ocean of high performance and low cost In 2001 Lockheed Martin won the contract to build the F35 based on the prototype aircraft it had developed The Pentagon was confident that the program would be an important success Yet as of 2014 the execution of the F35 program has been anything but good The project has suffered significant cost escalations schedule delays and compromises on the value it promised to deliver The F35 program is a good example of a blue ocean idea that has performed poorly mainly due to bad execution A variety of reasons have been cited as possible causes of poor execution such as the sheer size and complexity of the program and an overemphasis by Lockheed on shortterm business goals over successful delivery of the project Yet these very reasons underlie what make fair process that much more important A close look reveals that many of the problems that have plagued the F35s execution can be traced to a lack of engagement explanation and expectation clarity among the military Lockheed and the complex network of other external stakeholders upon which the projects successful execution relied The lack of the three E principles of fair process negatively affected both the knowledge sharing and voluntary cooperation that were needed At the time the F35 project got underway the Pentagon was operating according to a relatively handsoff management policy an outgrowth of the deregulation wave of the 1990s The aim was to reduce costly government oversight and give contractors more autonomy once a contract was awarded In the case of the F35 project however this went a few steps too far and resulted in a lack of effective engagement with Lockheed The outcome is that Lockheed ended up making as much as twothirds of key decisions in design development testing fielding and production of the F 35 without the Pentagons active engagement and input With technical experts from the Army Navy and Marines not actively sought nor fully utilized in key design decisions that arose opportunities to share explain refute and synthesize different ideas and knowledge among stakeholders to enhance the quality of execution were minimal Such lack of engagement and explanation further dampened the three military branches willingness to compromise on their own specifications as such needs arose putting further pressure on the costs of the project Moreover expectations remained unclear to the extent that interpretations of the contract differed among the stakeholders Lockheed was given very broad guidelines such as the airplane had to be maintainable able to operate from airfields stealthy and able to drop weapons8 Without detailed specifications the Pentagon increasingly found that the contractor had a very different view of how to interpret the contractual document According to Lieutenant General Christopher Bogdan who has been in charge of the Pentagons F35 program since December 2012 the result is that while the military would say the F35 needs to do X Y and Z Lockheed Martin would respond that it was only given a general mandate to do something general like Z9 Mixed expectations meant further revisions costs and mutual accusations In addition clear expectations were also absent for the complex network of subcontractors For example while the inspector general of the Pentagon faulted the office in charge of the F35 program for not adequately passing down key safety quality and technical requirements to the contractors and subcontractors the program office expected Lockheed Martin to be responsible for ensuring compliance of its subcontractors The result was nonconforming hardware and software with Lockheed Martin and its subcontractors not applying the rigor to design manufacturing and quality assurance processes that the Pentagon expected and counted on The lack of definitive requirements affected suppliers ability to qualify its processes and ensure delivery of compliant products The negative effect of this was magnified exponentially as accelerated concurrent production was used whereby the initial production of the F35 began even before flight tests had begun As the F35 program continued to discover an alarming rate of problems in specifications quality and standards this has meant a continuing high need for very costly timeintensive rework of aircraft While the violation of fair process and bad communication among internal and external stakeholders have contributed to the poor execution of the F35 project attempts are being made to face up to the problem and rectify it through more engagement and explanation with clearer agreements In September 2013 Bogdan said Im encouraged by where we are today I can tell you that when you start communicating and you start listening to each other you start finding solutions to problems instead of finding blame10 Of course only time will tell if the Pentagon will be able establish and maintain a culture of active engagement explanation and expectation clarity among the complex web of internal and external stakeholders needed to finally pull off the F35 project One thing is certain however As experience to date shows the Pentagon cannot afford to let fair process and the voluntary cooperation and knowledge sharing that goes with it slip any longer We are now ready to put our learning all together to address the important issue of strategy alignment in our next chapter Strategy alignment is an integral concept that embraces and synthesizes our core points and discussions in the previous chapters It closes the loop ensuring that all parts of an organizations strategy from value to profit to people presented so far are mutually reinforcing so that it becomes a high performing and sustainable strategy CHAPTER 9 Align Value Profit and People Propositions WHEN WE ASK PEOPLE to define what blue ocean strategy is and what drives its success we typically get one of three answers Some see it as fundamentally about how to reconstruct market boundaries and offer a leap in value to buyers Others see the essence of blue ocean strategy as about unlocking business model innovation through strategic pricing target costing and the like so a company can seize new customers profitably And still others see it as fundamentally about releasing the creativity knowledge sharing and voluntary cooperation of people through the proper approach to employees and partners All three are correct answers Indeed we have so far discussed each of these in turn laying out tools and frameworks that companies can apply to make each happen in a riskminimizing and opportunitymaximizing manner However while all three are correct they are also only partial answers This brings us to the next to last principle of blue ocean strategy alignment where we close the loop between creating and capturing blue oceans so that it becomes a highperforming and sustainable strategy The Three Strategy Propositions At the highest level there are three propositions essential to the success of strategy the value proposition the profit proposition and the people proposition1 For any strategy to be successful and sustainable an organization must develop an offering that attracts buyers it must create a business model that enables the company to make money out of its offering and it must motivate the people working for or with the company to execute the strategy While good strategy content is based on a compelling value proposition for buyers with a robust profit proposition for the organization sustainable strategy execution is based largely on a motivatingpeople proposition Motivating people requires more than overcoming organizational hurdles and winning peoples trust with fair process It also rests on aligned and fair incentives In this sense the three strategy propositions provide an organizing framework to ensure an organization is taking a holistic approach to the formulation and execution of strategy2 If a strategy does not fully develop and align the three strategy propositions shortlived success or failure typically results This is a trap many companies fall into Lacking a holistic understanding of strategy it is easy for an organization to focus overridingly on one or two strategy propositions to the exclusion of the others For example think of an organization that zealously focuses on getting the value or profit proposition right but pays little heed to getting the people proposition aligned Corporate graveyards are filled with such examples This is a classic case of execution failure Likewise good strategy execution via a motivatingpeople proposition with poor strategy content as reflected in the value or profit proposition is also a path to poor performance In some situations there may be more than one group of stakeholders that a strategy proposition must address For example if successful strategy execution rests on the buyin of only employees there is only a need for one people proposition But when a company needs the support of a supply chain partner for example it must also give the potential partner a compelling reason to back the strategy In that case a company would be required to have a distinct people proposition for both employees and the supply chain partner Similarly in a businesstobusiness environment there might have to be two value propositions one for the business customer and another for the business customers customers Strategic alignment is the responsibility of an organizations top executives versus those in charge of marketing manufacturing human resources or other functions Executives with a strong functional bias typically cannot successfully fulfill this important role because they tend to focus on a part not the whole of the three strategy propositions hence missing the alignment A manufacturing department for example might neglect buyer needs or treat people as a cost variable Similarly a marketing department might focus on the value proposition and pay insufficient heed to the other two propositions However when the three disparate strategy propositions that cut across an organization are fully developed and aligned a highperforming and sustainable strategy is achieved Creating a full set of consistent strategy propositions is of course essential whether a firm follows blue ocean or red ocean strategy Where the two approaches really diverge is how organizations achieve alignment around the strategy propositions Under red ocean strategy an organizations three strategy propositions need to be aligned with the distinctive choice of pursuing either differentiation or low cost within given industry conditions Here differentiation and low cost represent alternative strategic positions in an industry In contrast under blue ocean strategy an organization achieves high performance when all three strategy propositions pursue both differentiation and low cost It is this alignment in support of differentiation and low cost that ensures a successful blue ocean strategy that has sustainability See figure 91 While one or two strategy propositions can be imitated imitating all three is difficult especially the people proposition because it is embedded in human relationships that take time to cultivate When external stakeholders are involved and important getting the people proposition right takes even more time and effort for potential imitators hence typically prolonging the aligned strategys sustainability FIGURE 91 Achieving strategy alignment Achieving Blue Ocean Strategic Alignment To understand how an organization achieves alignment to produce a high performing and sustainable blue ocean strategy lets look at Comic Relief a UK fundraising charity Founded in 1985 Comic Relief leapfrogged existing UK fundraising charities and emerged as one of the most distinctive charities in the UK that also enjoys the lowest costs In an overcrowded industry that suffered rising costs declining demand and a public confused by the sheer number of fundraising charities Comic Relief rapidly achieved 96 percent national brand awareness and has raised over 950 million by inspiring everyone from traditional wealthy donors to previous nondonors to give Whats more while UK charities get on average only 45 percent of their funds from the publicthe rest coming from government grants and corporationsComic Relief has raised 100 percent of its donations directly from the public and has done so with no paid marketing or mail solicitations Now nearly thirty years on there are still no credible imitators in the blue ocean it created Lets see how it has achieved this sustained high performance through alignment In the case of Comic Relief customers are donors whom it needs to attract with a compelling value proposition Its profit proposition is about the business model it built to maximize its profit which for Comic Relief is its revenue surplus over costs that can ultimately flow to charities And its people proposition is about the positive incentives and motivations put in place for its employees and network of volunteer fundraisers corporate partners and celebrities Consider the differences between Comic Relief and other UK charities value profit and people propositions As we go through these you will see that when the three strategy propositions are aligned around differentiation and low cost key factors from one proposition often support and reinforce the other two propositions creating a strong positive cycle For example organizations can leverage a compelling value proposition to strengthen its profit and people propositions or build on a powerful people proposition to create a strong value proposition which in turn strengthens the profit proposition which makes imitation that much more difficult Heres how Comic Reliefs value profit and people propositions work The Value Proposition Traditional fundraising charities in the UK use sad or shocking images in their campaigns stimulating negative feelings of guilt and pity to trigger donations Their focus is on securing and recognizing large gifts mainly from highincome educated older donors through yearround campaigns and solicitations of funds Comic Relief in contrast has eliminated pity and guilt It uses a breakthrough new fundraising approach Red Nose Day a double whammy combination of a national day of whacky community fun draising when people volunteer to perform zany antics to raise money and a starstudded comedy telethon Red Nose Night Forget pity Its all about doing something funny for money to change the world With Comic Relief donors dont need to write a big check Taking part is cheap easy and fun People can contribute by buying a little plastic red nose that costs a 1 is sold everywhere and cant help but make you smile Over 66 million have been purchased so far everyone wears them Or you can donate by sponsoring the silly antics of friends family neighbors or colleagues thereby giving money while having a great laugh For example friends and colleagues sponsored a London travel agent with a reputation as a chatterbox to stay silent for twentyfour hours they collectively donated over 500 in sponsorship while having a blast watching the chatterbox struggle to stay silent Comic Reliefs unique use of community fundraising not only leverages peoples fondness to have fun Its also personal It is not some unknown person asking for donations as at most other charities Rather its a friend loved one or colleague who you care about and want to support Unlike traditional charities Comic Relief values and recognizes even the tiniest donation for example when Red Nose Night explains that the generous donation of one little girl who gave all her pocket money of 190 will feed seven children in Africa People know their every cent counts and makes a difference This opens the door for even the poorest and youngest person to realize that even he can make a major contribution and become part of a greater cause of personally contributing to changing the world While traditional charities solicit funds from a regular base of supporters yearround and every year Comic Relief focuses on creating this unique experience once every two years to avoid boredom and nagging Instead of feeling donor fatigue as with other charities continuous solicitations people actually look forward to the excitement of the next Red Nose Day which has nearly become a national holiday in the UK Lastly Comic Relief donates 100 percent of all funds raised with its golden pound promise that it spends none of the funds on its own overhead or operating costs as the average UK charity does This transparency is reassuring to people who often wonder what percent of funds actually makes its way to charity The result is a value proposition that not only is fun exciting and clear but also allows donors to make a huge difference with a small donation In other words it is differentiated and low cost affordable to everyone from the very young to the very old and from low to high income The Profit Proposition How does Comic Relief raise such extraordinary sums and support its operations while maintaining the golden pound promise It has done so by complementing its compelling value proposition with an unbeatable profit proposition that simultaneously achieves a lowcost structure while generating funds in a differentiated way Traditional charities use a variety of methods to raise funds from several sources such as writing grant proposals to governments trusts and foundations holding fundraising galas for wealthy influential people and corporations directly soliciting via mail and telemarketing and operating charity shops Almost all these activities entail significant overhead costs in staff management and administration as well as the possible renting or purchase of facilities Comic Relief by contrast eliminated all of these It doesnt plow time and money into expensive fundraising galas it doesnt write grants to solicit funds from governments and foundations and it doesnt have charity shops Instead it leverages existing high street retail outlets from supermarkets to fashion stores to sell its little red noses And because Comic Relief makes grants to other charities rather than introducing competing programs into an already crowded market the costs of administering the funds it raises are cut dramatically By some estimates Comic Relief has stripped away more than 75 percent of traditional fund raising operations Comic Relief can afford to keep costs low due to the unique way it raises money What Comic Relief understood is that with community fun draising it is no longer the charity pushing the donor to make a contribution but the cause pulling the donor in And with people volunteering to do the bulk of fundraising by engaging in silly antics that others sponsor Comic Reliefs staff costs stay very low Whereas traditional charities use of community fundraising is completely accidental and infrequent through Red Nose Day Comic Relief focuses on community fundraising making it the systematic dominant channel through which to get contributions While traditional fundraising charities tend to focus on wealthy older donors Red Nose Day is all about targeting the mass and raising funds via lots of small increments On Red Nose Day ordinary people do extraordinary things and raise huge amounts of money from a large number of small contributions Whats more Red Nose Nightthe starstudded comedy extravaganza that makes people laugh to raise money for charitydoesnt cost a penny Everyone gives his or her services for free the network the studios the stars Unlike traditional charities that engage in costly marketing to stand out in the overcrowded industry Comic Relief avoids large advertising costs thanks to the widespread media attention and free wordofmouth advertising that all the excitement of Red Nose Day generates To help Comic Relief realize its golden pound promise corporate partners cover its operating costs in cash or in kind The overall result is that Comic Relief has not only a compelling value proposition but a differentiated lowcost profit proposition The People Proposition At Comic Relief all the people involved win not just those they help With a small number of motivated staff members who are inspired by its value proposition Comic Reliefs people proposition focuses on inspiring volunteer fundraisers corporate sponsors and celebrities whose buyin is needed to make the value and profit propositions sustainable Toward this end Comic Relief begins by creating a legitimate platform Red Nose Day for everyone to go a bit mad and have an outrageous time volunteering in order to raise money Next Comic Relief makes participating easy its website offers all sorts of zany ideas to fire up your imagination for funny antics and tips on how to get people you know to easily sponsor you By taking part and becoming an actor in fundraising people earn the respect of friends family and colleagues while feeling a sense of pride that they are visibly part of a group working to better the world By offering people the opportunity to be actively involved in raising money through silly antics not only are people having fun but they become part of a greater cause of personally contributing to bettering the world With Comic Relief volunteers are the actors in fundraising and part of a large oneday event where everyone is doing his or her share to positively change the world while having a great time All of this is achieved while conserving volunteers most valuable resource time participating in Comic Relief doesnt take a lot as you only have to do something silly every other year In this way Comic Relief creates a compelling lowcost people proposition that inspires people across the nation to volunteer and fundraise on behalf of Comic Relief Contrast this with traditional charities where volunteering can be a drag and people often silently feel they are sacrificing to help out Comic Reliefs lowcost and differentiated people proposition extends to corporations and celebrities as well Only in this case in addition to the benefits that ordinary citizens get for volunteering sponsoring corporations and participating celebrities get tremendous free publicity across the UK Thats because Comic Reliefs differentiated lowcost value proposition triggers enormous free press including over two hundred hours of TV time hundreds of hours of radio coverage and over ten thousand press articles The result is that Comic Relief does not have to beg corporate sponsors or celebrities to take part Instead it has corporate sponsors and celebrities eager to volunteer to help it realize its golden pound promise of giving 100 percent of donations to great causes creating a win all around As the Comic Relief case illustrates the aligned value profit and people propositions around differentiation and low cost create powerful reinforcing synergies and a winwin for all When a Strategy Is Not Properly Aligned While a properly aligned blue ocean strategy like Comic Reliefs has an inherent sustainability because it is hard to imitate when not properly aligned even a compelling blue ocean idea with an impressive market entry may not sustain its appeal and struggle to get back its initial momentum or end up failing in some cases This is why so many innovations to create new markets generate initial market excitement but fizzle out Take the case of the Tata Nano At its launch the Tata Nano was hailed as the peoples car It garnered more media attention than any other car launch in the world at the time It also achieved the biggest sales uptake in the history of the global automobile industry After it was officially introduced in March 2009 more than two hundred thousand orders poured in within two weeks There is reason Its value proposition had the hallmarks of a blue ocean Tata Motors reconstructed key buyer value factors across the passenger car market and the twowheeler market to offer the Tata Nano Like the passenger car the Tata Nano offered a safe comfortable reliable and respectable allweather means of transportation for Indian families At the same time however the Nano was priced against the farlowercost twowheeled vehicle market that most Indian families relied on for their daily transportation needs In this way Tata Nanos value proposition offered buyers both differentiation and low cost putting an automobile within reach of most Indians for the first time Tata Motors matched its compelling value proposition with a compelling profit proposition Under the guidance of Ratan Tata chairman of the Tata Group the Nano team introduced a series of cost innovations in design manufacturing marketing and maintenance that resulted in a profit proposition that was both differentiated and low cost The Nano for example used a twocylinder rear engine combined with rearwheel drive to not only lower costs but also provide better fuel efficiency and more interior space without an increase in the size of the car The Nanos two cylinder engine was also made of aluminium instead of the steel of conventional engines which was lighter cost less to build and also provided better fuel efficiency And the component parts were dramatically simplified for example its door handles were designed with 70 percent fewer parts While the Nano team eliminated nonessential luxury features in its profit proposition it did not reduce costs across the board For example making the Nano a twodoor car could have achieved substantial cost savings but it would have greatly inconvenienced the typical multigenerational Indian family and therefore was not adopted It would be hard for example for a grandmother in a sari to get in the backseat In this way Tata Nanos cost reduction efforts reinforced rather than compromised its value proposition resulting in a wellaligned differentiated and lowcost profit proposition Yet despite its compelling value proposition and a viable profit proposition the Tata Nanos initial success was not sustained and ended up failing to meet sales targets and public expectations What went wrong A closer look reveals that this setback arose largely from a major weakness in the people proposition for a critical external stakeholder group whose cooperation Tata depended on Despite its good will and intentions Tata was unable to secure the cooperation of the Singur community in West Bengal where Tata set out to establish its manufacturing facilities The focal dispute was mainly about the leasing of arable land for industrial use and the negotiation process and level of compensation for the local owners in the community This misalignment caused Tata Nanos massive facility relocation and dampened the Nanos initial success While Tata has since put a new team together to get the Nano back on track it is a good example of how a misaligned proposition can bring about negative performance consequences To produce a highperforming and sustainable blue ocean strategy you need to ask the following questions Are your three strategy propositions aligned in pursuit of differentiation and low cost Have you identified all the key stakeholders including external ones on which the effective execution of your blue ocean strategy will depend Have you developed compelling people propositions for each of these to ensure they are motivated and behind the execution of your new idea Putting It All Together The examples of Napster and Apples iTunes in the digital music industry allow us to put this all together two strategic moves both seeking to create and capture uncontested market space with digital music Napster had the clear firstmover advantage pulled in over 80 million registered users and was generally loved for its value proposition but its strategy ultimately failed It had no sustainability In contrast iTunes achieved sustainable success and both dominated and grew the blue ocean of digital music Fundamentally what separates the outcomes of these two strategic moves is alignment The Napster team lacking a holistic view of strategy failed to align its external people proposition for its partners to support the compelling value it unlocked When the record labels approached Napster to work out a revenuesharing model for the digital download of music that would create a winwin for both sides Napster balked The excitement over Napsters spectacular growth prevented it from appreciating that it needed an external people proposition that offered differentiation and low cost for its key partners the record labels Rather than work to build a compelling people proposition that would strike a winwin arrangement with record labels Napster took a belligerent approach declaring it would advance with or without the record labels support The rest is history Napster was forced to shut down due to copyright infringement This prevented Napster from ever developing a profit proposition that could benefit from its huge user base Lacking strategy alignment Napsters success was shortlived Apple by contrast created a set of fully developed and aligned strategy propositions Its compelling value proposition for buyers was complemented by a compelling people proposition for its external partners major music companies allowing Apple to gain the support of all five major music companiesBMG EMI Group Sony Universal Music Group and Warner Brothers Records With iTunes music companies receive 70 percent of the purchase price of every song downloaded creating a winwin proposition for both Apple and business partners And since Apples iTunes also drove sales of its already hot iPod iTunes multiplied the companys profit proposition creating a positive reinforcing cycle of profit across the two platforms The result the alignment across iTunes value profit and people propositions ushered in a new era of music allowing Apple to create capture and dominate a new market space in digital music Do you have a holistic understanding of strategy Has your new strategy fully developed and aligned the three strategy propositions for sustained success The continuing success of your companys strategy depends on it This brings us to our discussion of the last principle of blue ocean strategy in which we address the important issue of the renewal of blue oceans over time CHAPTER 10 Renew Blue Oceans CREATING A BLUE OCEAN is not a static achievement but a dynamic process Once a company creates a blue ocean and its powerful performance consequences are known sooner or later imitators appear on the horizon Here the questions are How soon or late will they come How easy or difficult is a blue ocean strategy to imitate Put differently what are the barriers to imitation As the company and its early imitators succeed and expand the blue ocean more and more companies jump in eventually turning the color of the ocean red This raises a related question When should a company reach out to create another blue ocean to renew its business or its portfolio of businesses In this chapter we address the issues of imitation and the renewal of blue ocean strategy by answering these questions Understanding the process of renewal is key to ensure that the creation of blue oceans is not a oneoff occurrence but is institutionalized as a repeatable process in an organization Barriers to Imitation A blue ocean strategy brings with it considerable barriers to imitation that effectively prolong sustainability They range from alignment to cognitive organizational brand economic and legal barriers More often than not a blue ocean strategy will go without credible challenges for many years Cirque du Soleils blue ocean endured over twenty years Comic Reliefs nearly thirty years Apples iTunes now more than ten years The list goes on from JCDecaux to Intuits Quicken to Salesforcecom This sustainability can be traced to the following imitation barriers The alignment barrier As discussed in chapter 9 the alignment of the three strategy propositionsvalue profit and peopleinto an integral system around both differentiation and low cost builds sustainability and hence forms a formidable barrier to imitation The cognitive and organizational barrier A value innovation move does not make sense based on conventional strategic logic When CNN was introduced for example NBC CBS and ABC ridiculed the idea of twentyfourhour sevenday realtime news without star broadcasters CNN was referred to as Chicken Noodle News by the industry Ridicule does not inspire rapid imitation as it creates a cognitive barrier Moreover because imitation often requires companies to make substantial changes to their existing business practices organizational politics often kick in delaying for years a companys commitment to imitate a blue ocean strategy When Southwest Airlines for example created a service that offered the speed of air travel with the cost and flexibility of driving imitating this blue ocean strategy would have meant major revisions in routing planes retraining staff and changing marketing and pricing not to mention culturesignificant organizational changes that the politics of few companies can bear in the short term The brand barrier Brand image conflict prevents companies from imitating a blue ocean strategy The blue ocean strategy of The Body Shop for examplewhich shunned beautiful models promises of eternal beauty and youth and expensive packagingleft major cosmetic houses the world over actionless for years because imitation would signal an invalidation of their current business models Also when a company offers a leap in value it rapidly earns brand buzz and a loyal following in the marketplace Even large advertising budgets by an aggressive imitator rarely have the strength to overtake the brand buzz earned by the value innovator Microsoft for example tried for years to dislodge Intuits value innovation Quicken After nearly thirty years of efforts and investment it finally threw in the towel and ceased operations of its contender Microsoft Money in 2009 The economic and legal barrier Natural monopoly blocks imitation when the size of a market cannot support another player For example the Belgian cinema company Kinepolis created the first megaplex in Europe in the city of Brussels and has not been imitated in Brussels for nearly thirty years despite its enormous success The reason is that the size of Brussels could not support a second megaplex which would cause both Kinepolis and its imitator to suffer Moreover the high volume generated by a value innovation leads to rapid cost advantages placing potential imitators at an ongoing cost disadvantage The huge economies of scale in purchasing enjoyed by Walmart for example have significantly discouraged other companies from imitating its blue ocean strategy Network externalities also block companies from easily and credibly imitating a blue ocean strategy much as Twitter has enjoyed in social media In short the more users a site has online the more attractive it generally becomes to everyone creating scant incentive for people to switch to a potential imitator Other than these economic factors patents or legal permits also block imitation as they grant a value innovator an exclusive legal right Figure 101 provides a snapshot of these barriers to imitation As the figure shows the barriers are numerous and nontrivial This is why in many industries companies that created blue oceans do not face credible challenges for many years while the speed of imitation varies across industries FIGURE 101 Imitation barriers to blue ocean strategy Renewal Eventually however almost every blue ocean strategy will be imitated As imitators try to grab a share of the blue ocean an organization created it typically launches offenses to defend its hardearned customer base But imitators often persist Obsessed with hanging on to market share the organization tends to fall into the trap of competing racing to beat the new competition Over time the competition and not the buyer all too often comes to occupy the center of its strategic thought and actions If an organization stays on this course the basic shape of its strategic profile or value curve will begin to converge with those of the competition To avoid the trap of competing renewal is needed The questions here are When should a singlebusiness firm valueinnovate again And how can a multibusiness firm renew its portfolio of businesses in blue ocean terms as competition heats up Renewal at the Individual Business Level To avoid the trap of competing at the individual business level monitoring value curves on the strategy canvas is essential Monitoring value curves signals when to valueinnovate and when not to It alerts an organization to reach out for another blue ocean when its value curve begins to converge with those of the competition It also keeps a company from pursuing another blue ocean when there is still a huge profit stream to be collected from its current offering When a companys value curve still has focus divergence and a compelling tagline it should resist the temptation to valueinnovate the business again and instead should focus on lengthening widening and deepening its rent stream through operational improvements and geographical expansion to achieve maximum economies of scale and market coverage It should swim as far as possible in the blue ocean making itself a moving target distancing itself from early imitators and discouraging them in the process The aim here is to dominate the blue ocean over imitators for as long as possible As rivalry intensifies and total supply exceeds demand bloody competition commences and the ocean will turn red As competitors value curves converge an organization should begin reaching out for another value innovation to create a new blue ocean Hence by charting a companys value curve on the strategy canvas and intermittently replotting its competitors value curves versus its own a company will be able to visually see the degree of imitation and hence of value curve convergence and the extent to which its blue ocean is turning red The Body Shop for example dominated the blue ocean it had created for more than a decade The company however is now in the middle of a bloody red ocean with declining performance It did not reach out for another value innovation when competitors value curves converged with its own yellow tail has also dominated the blue ocean it created for more than a decade and has since been successfully rolling out across the globe It made the competition irrelevant and has enjoyed strong profitable growth as a result However today numerous other players have since jumped into the blue waters of new market space The test of Casella Wines longrun profitable growth will be its ability to valueinnovate again before imitators are able to compete both aggressively and credibly with converging value curves Its also time for others like Cirque du Soleil and Curves to reach for a new blue ocean Hence understanding how to manage the dynamic process of continuous renewal is key A good example to illustrate this dynamic renewal process is Salesforcecom Salesforcecom made a series of successful strategic moves to renew its blue ocean in the B2B customer relationship management CRM industry Since its initial strategic move in the early 2000s Salesforcecom has sustained undisputed market leadership in the blue ocean of ondemand CRM automation that it created for nearly fifteen years This is all the more impressive as it operates in the fastmoving high tech sector While numerous competitors both large established incumbents with deep pockets and new upstarts have tried to dislodge it over the years Salesforcecom has repeatedly broken away from the pack by valueinnovating again as other companies value curves began to converge toward its own In this way it has successfully avoided the trap of competing and kept itself in the blue Consider In 2001 Salesforcecom redefined the traditional CRM software industry by effectively making traditional packaged software largely irrelevant Gone were the needs for expensive software complicated and time consuming clientside installation difficulty and risk in use and the constant need for costly maintenance and upgrades Instead Salesforcecom offered business users webbased CRM solutions that focused on core functionalities worked instantaneously upon subscription and had high reliability and usability with ubiquitous access at a small fraction of the cost of traditional CRM software In this way Salesforcecom created a blue ocean of all new demand that captured small and mediumsized companies that had effectively been noncustomers of the industry Over time however competitors jumped in to reap profits from the new market space of ondemand CRM automation that Salesforcecom created Large players offered hybrid solutions and an increasing number of small players entered the ondemand CRM market in an attempt to provide similar offerings To break away from the competition Salesforcecom made a new blue ocean strategic move to renew its initial value innovation offering With the launch of Forcecom a cloudbased development tool for creating addon applications and AppExchange a webbased applications marketplace Salesforcecom allowed corporate clients to obtain a range of ondemand customized programs at low cost while still retaining the simplicity convenience reliability and low risk of its original offering achieving both differentiation and low cost To discourage imitation and further deepen its blue ocean that competitors continued to eye Salesforcecom went a step further and extended its value curve by launching Chatter a private social networking service that allowed coworkers within a company to send receive and follow information updates in real time thereby enhancing collaboration and resolving the problem of fragmentation that plagued the implementation and use of traditional CRM systems In this way not only has Salesforcecom been able to maintain a gap between its value curve and those of others over time but it has also continued to expand the size of the blue ocean with large corporations now equally eager to deploy ondemand webbased CRM applications due to its successive value innovation moves Renewal at the Corporate Level for a Multibusiness Firm While the renewal issue for companies with a single business offering or product can be addressed by charting a businesss value curve against competitors on the strategy canvas over time as described a complementary tool is needed for companies that have a portfolio of diverse business offerings as executives responsible for corporate strategy should monitor and plan the renewal of their business portfolios from the corporate perspective A dynamic extension of the pioneermigratorsettler PMS map introduced in chapter 4 serves this purpose well It can be used to visually depict the movement of a corporate portfolio in one picture by capturing a corporations portfolio of business offerings over time By plotting the corporate portfolio as pioneers migrators and settlers on the dynamic PMS map executives can see at a glance where the gravity of its current portfolio of businesses is how this has shifted over time and when there is a need to create a new blue ocean to renew the portfolio As explained in chapter 4 settlers are metoo businesses migrators represent value improvements and pioneers are a companys value innovations While settlers are todays cash generators that typically have marginal growth potential pioneers have high growth potential but often consume cash at the outset as they expand migrators profitable growth potential lies somewhere in between To maximize growth prospects then a companys portfolio should have a healthy balance between pioneers for future growth and migrators and settlers for cash flow at a given point in time Over time however a companys current pioneers will eventually become migrators and then ultimately settlers as imitation begins and intensifies To maintain strong profitable growth executives need to ensure that as current pioneers become migrators the company is set to launch a new blue ocean either by regenerating an existing business or via a new business offering Consider Apple Inc in this regard FIGURE 102 Apples portfolio of businesses on the dynamic PMS map While the size of named circles roughly represents the relative revenues of Apples main businesses that of unnamed dots does not as they simply represent Apples peripheral products and services The Apple Store is not plotted although it is recognized as a blue ocean in the retail industry as its sales are already captured in all existing products Figure 102 depicts Apples portfolio of businesses on the dynamic PMS map A series of blue ocean strategic moves led Apple to become Americas most admired and valuable company within a decade The iMac iPod iTunes Store iPhone and iPad were created by different business units serving different industry sectors yet they shared a common strategic approachreconstructing the existing markets and creating new demand Although these strategic moves were planned and executed by individual business units it was Apple Inc that planned and orchestrated its business portfolio at the corporate level As seen in figure 102 Apple has maintained strong profitable growth by keeping a successful balance across its pioneers migrators and settlers over time even as once pioneers lost their pioneer status This was achieved by launching new blue ocean businesses as previous pioneer businesses were starting to be imitated In looking at Apples portfolio across time its profitable growth was first lifted in 1998 when it dramatically simplified its Macintosh product range and launched the valueinnovative iMac the first colorful friendly desktop computer that made it easy for the first time to connect to the internet The iMac literally made people smile and introduced fashion and aesthetics into computers While the iMac transformed Apples Macintosh division into a high migrator Apple quickly followed this with the launch of the iPod The iPod revolutionized the digital music market creating an uncontested blue ocean which was strengthened further with its launch of the iTunes Music Store two years later As the iPod was eventually imitated and sank toward migrator status Apple reached out and launched its next blue ocean the iPhone Apple continued to launch subsequent blue oceans over time including its app store and the iPad to ensure the next chunk of growth at the corporate level as others began to encroach on the blue oceans it was creating in its individual businesses As the dynamic PMS map also makes clear that is not to say that Apple is only about blue oceans nor should any companys corporate portfolio be Companies with a diverse portfolio of businesses such as Apple General Electric Johnson Johnson or Procter Gamble will always need to swim in both red and blue oceans at a given point in time and succeed in both oceans at the corporate level This means that understanding and applying the competitionbased principles of red ocean strategy are also needed Once Apples iPod began to be imitated for example to counter competition it rapidly launched a range of iPod variants at various price points with the iPod mini shuffle nano touch and so on This not only served to keep encroaching competitors at arms length but also expanded the size of the ocean it created allowing Apple not imitators to capture the lions share of the profit and growth of this new market space By the time the iPods blue ocean became crowded with more imitators Apple had created another blue ocean by introducing the iPhone In this way Apple has been successfully managing its corporate portfolio for strong profitable growth The challenge for Apple in going forward will be to continue to renew its portfolio as current pioneers eventually become migrators and settlers so that it can maintain a healthy balance between the profit of today and the growth of tomorrow This is the precise challenge Microsoft has been facing for several years Despite relatively strong profit Microsoft has failed to maintain a healthy balance across pioneers migrators and settlers While it has proven to be adept at knowing how to compete and get profit out of settler businesses Microsoft has launched no new pioneers whether a search engine like Google a social network site like Facebook a video game console like the Wii or popular web services like Twitter to renew its corporate portfolio Its deep dependence on the settler businesses of Office and Windows that dominate its portfolio has severely penalized Microsoft Profit aside its stock price has been unimpressive for more than a decade and even more telling it has lost its luster in attracting top talent For Microsoft to get out of its slump it needs to work toward creating a better balanced portfolio across businesses that not only compete in red oceans but also create blue oceans which renew expand and build its brand value The eight principles of blue ocean strategy proposed in this book should serve as essential pointers for every company thinking about its future strategy if it aspires to lead the increasingly overcrowded business world This is not to suggest that companies will suddenly stop competing or that the competition will suddenly come to a halt On the contrary the competition will be more present and will remain a critical factor of market reality As captured on the dynamic PMS map red ocean and blue ocean strategies are complementary strategic perspectives with each serving different and important purposes Because blue and red oceans have always coexisted practical reality demands that companies succeed in both oceans and master the strategies for both But because companies already understand how to compete in red oceans what they need to learn is how to make the competition irrelevant This book aims to help balance the scales so that formulating and executing blue ocean strategy can become as systematic and actionable as competing in the red oceans of known market space CHAPTER 11 Avoid Red Ocean Traps IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF OUR BOOK we focused on defining what blue ocean strategy is and offering frameworks and analytic tools for creating commercially relevant new market space as expressed by the strategy canvas four actions framework the six paths and so on At the time we felt reassured that we had reached a level of articulation and clarity on blue ocean strategy that would prevent misunderstandings from arising by all who chose to dive into the book Over the ensuing years however we found that our assumption was not fully correct Peoples mental models coming from their backgrounds and preexisting knowledge led them to often interpret blue ocean strategy through old conceptual lenses that inadvertently trapped them in the red ocean In particular we identified ten common red ocean traps that work against the creation of blue oceans Understanding these red ocean traps is critical they have powerful implications for practice If any one of these red ocean traps raises its head in your organization beat it down You have to get your framing right to create blue oceans Perspective is critical to success Your mindset is more ingrained than you realize Hence we end this expanded edition by laying out the ten common red ocean traps that keep organizations locked in the red ocean even as they attempt to sail into clear waters To get the most out of the blue ocean strategy methodologies and tools as they are used in practice an accurate understanding on the underpinning concepts that guide their proper application is essential Red Ocean Trap One The belief that blue ocean strategy is a customeroriented strategy thats about being customer led A blue ocean strategist gains insights about reconstructing market boundaries not by looking at existing customers but by exploring noncustomers When organizations mistakenly assume that blue ocean strategy is about being customer led they reflexively focus on what theyve always focused on existing customers and how to make them happier While such a perspective may shed insight on ways to improve value for current industry customers it is not the path to create new demand To create new demand an organization needs to turn its focus to noncustomers and why they refuse to patronize an industry Noncustomers not customers hold the greatest insight into an industrys pain points and points of intimidation that limit the size and boundary of the industry This is why to create new demand analyzing and understanding the three tiers of noncustomers are essential components of blue ocean strategy A focus on existing customers by contrast tends to drive organizations to do more of the same for less thereby anchoring companies in the red ocean irrespective of their blue ocean intent Red Ocean Trap Two The belief that to create blue oceans you must venture beyond your core business There is a common misperception that to create a blue ocean and break out of the red organizations must venture into industries outside their core which understandably appears to multiply risk And a select few do Virgin is a classic example and Apple in recent years metamorphosed from a computer maker to a consumer electronics and media giant These however are exceptions not the rule Blue oceans can just as easily and more readily be created smack in the middle of an organizations existing core businesses Think of Casella Wines with yellow tail in the wine industry Nintendo with the Wii Chrysler with the minivan Apple with its iMac Philips with Alto in the professional lighting industry or even the New York City Police Department with Brattons blue ocean strategic move in policing All come from within not beyond red oceans of existing industries This challenges the view that new markets are in distant waters Blue oceans are right next to you in every industry Understanding this is key When companies mistakenly believe that they must venture beyond their core business to create blue oceans they tend to either shy away from venturing beyond the red ocean or to the contrary look far afield to other industries that have little overlap with their knowledge skills and competencies which makes success that much more difficult with failed attempts keeping them locked in the red ocean Red Ocean Trap Three The misconception that blue ocean strategy is about new technologies A blue ocean strategic move is not about technology innovation per se Think of Comic Relief yellow tail JCDecaux or Starbucks for starters all made blue ocean strategic moves that involved no bleedingedge new technologies Even where technology is heavily involved as with Salesforcecom Intuits Quicken or Apples iPhone the reason buyers love these blue ocean offerings isnt because they involve bleedingedge technology per se but because these offerings make the technology essentially disappear from buyers minds The products and services are so simple easy to use fun and productive that buyers fall in love with them So technology is not a defining feature You can create blue oceans with or without it However where technology is involved its key that you link it to value Ask How does your product or service offer a leap in productivity simplicity ease of use convenience fun andor environmental friendliness Without that bleedingedge technology notwithstanding you wont open up a blue ocean of commercial opportunity Value innovation not technology innovation is what opens up commercially compelling new markets When companies mistakenly assume blue ocean strategy hinges on new technologies their organizations tend to push for products or services that are either too out there too complicated or lacking the complementary ecosystem needed to open up a new market space Red Ocean Trap Four The belief that to create a blue ocean you must be first to market Blue ocean strategy is not about being first to market Rather its about being first to get it right by linking innovation to value One need only look to Apple here The iMac wasnt the first PC the iPod wasnt the first MP3 player iTunes wasnt the first digital music store and the iPhone certainly wasnt the first smart phone nor for that matter was the iPad the first smart tablet But what they all successfully did was link innovation to value Organizations that mistakenly assume blue ocean strategy is about being first to market all too often get their priorities wrong They inadvertently put speed before value While speed is important speed alone will not unlock a blue ocean Corporate graveyards are full of companies that got to market first with innovative offerings not linked to value1 To avoid this trap companies need to continuously drive home the idea that while speed may be important even more important is linking innovation to value No company should rest easy until it achieves value innovation Red Ocean Trap Five The misconception that blue ocean strategy and differentiation strategy are synonymous Under traditional competitive strategy differentiation is achieved by providing premium value at a higher cost to the company and at a higher price for customers Think Mercedes Benz Differentiation is a strategic choice that reflects the valuecost tradeoff in a given market structure Blue ocean strategy by contrast is about breaking the valuecost tradeoff to open up new market space It is about pursuing differentiation and low cost simultaneously Is Casella Wines yellow tail or Comic Reliefs Red Nose Day differentiated in terms of having a different strategic profile than other players You bet But are they also low cost Yes again Blue ocean strategy is an andand not an eitheror strategy When companies mistakenly assume that blue ocean strategy is synonymous with differentiation they all too often miss the andand of blue ocean strategy Instead they tend to focus on what to raise and create to stand apart and pay scant heed to what they can eliminate and reduce to simultaneously achieve low cost In this way organizations inadvertently become either premium competitors or differentiated niche players in existing industry space rather than creating value innovation that makes the competition irrelevant Red Ocean Trap Six The misconception that blue ocean strategy is a lowcost strategy that focuses on low pricing This red ocean trap is the obvious flip side of red ocean trap five and pops up just as often Again blue ocean strategy pursues differentiation and low cost simultaneously by reconstructing market boundaries Instead of focusing on low cost per se it seeks to create a leap in buyer value at a lower cost Further a blue ocean strategic move captures the mass of target buyers not through lowcost pricing but through strategic pricing The key here is not to pursue pricing against the competition within an industry but to pursue pricing against substitutes and alternatives that are currently capturing the noncustomers of your industry Using strategic pricing a blue ocean does not have to be created at the low end of the market Instead it can be created at the high end as Cirque du Soleil Starbucks or Dyson did at the low end as Southwest Airlines or Swatch did or in the middle range of a market Even where blue oceans are created at the low end as in the case of Southwest Airlines or Swatch which have among the lowest price points and cost structures in the airline and watch industries respectively ask yourself do you think of these as low cost alone If you are like most your answer is no True they are low cost and low priced but they also stand out and are clearly differentiated in the eyes of buyers Southwest Airlines stands out for its friendly fast groundtransportationintheair feel while Swatchs stylish fun designs set it apart and make it a fashion statement That is they are perceived as being both differentiated and low cost even at the low end of the market When organizations miss this point and mistakenly see blue ocean strategy as synonymous with low cost and low pricing they inadvertently focus on what to eliminate and reduce in the current industry offering to offer rock bottom prices In doing so they fail to simultaneously focus on what they should raise and create to also achieve the differentiation needed to stand apart and set sail into the blue ocean Red Ocean Trap Seven The belief that blue ocean strategy is the same as innovation Blue ocean strategy is not synonymous with innovation per se Unlike blue ocean strategy innovation is a very broad concept that is based on an original and useful idea regardless of whether that idea is linked to a leap in value that can appeal to the mass of buyers Take Motorolas Iridium Was it an innovation Sure It was the first global phone and it was useful But was it a value innovation No As Motorola learned a breakthrough in technology is not necessarily synonymous with a breakthrough in value that can attract the target mass of buyers The Iridium was a useful technological feat that worked around the world including the far reaches of the Gobi desert but did not work in buildings and cars the precise places that global executives on the move most needed them to work It failed to create a leap in value for its target mass of buyersbusiness executives In fact many technology innovators fail to create and capture blue oceans by confusing innovation with value innovation the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy Value innovation not innovation per se is the singular focus of blue ocean strategy Simply creating something original and useful through innovation is not enough to create and capture a blue ocean even if the innovation wins the company accolades and its researchers a Nobel Prize To capture a commercially compelling blue ocean companies need a strategy that can align their value profit and people propositions in pursuit of both differentiation and low cost When organizations fail to register the difference between value innovation and innovation per se they all too often end with an innovation that breaks new ground but does not unlock the mass of target buyers keeping them by and large stuck in the red ocean Red Ocean Trap Eight The belief that blue ocean strategy is a theory of marketing and a niche strategy Certainly the blue ocean strategy frameworks and tools can be effectively deployed to reframe analyze and resolve the marketing issues of an organization as it strives to break out of the red ocean Especially relevant are those issues related to developing a blue ocean value proposition as discussed in the beginning chapters of the book However blue ocean strategy requires more than a compelling value proposition As we discuss in the second half of the book sustainable success can only be achieved when a companys value proposition is supported by key internal and external people involved in its execution and is complemented by a strong profit proposition Hence to equate blue ocean strategy with a theory of marketing myopically masks the holistic approach needed to create a sustainable highperformance strategy including overcoming organizational hurdles winning peoples trust and commitment and creating the proper incentives via a compelling people proposition This inaccurate understanding of blue ocean strategy can often lead to a lack of alignment across the three strategy propositions of value profit and people Blue ocean strategy should also not be confused with a niche strategy While the field of marketing has placed significant emphasis on finer segmentation to effectively capture niche markets blue ocean strategy works in the reverse direction It is more about desegmenting markets by focusing on key commonalities across buyer groups to open up and capture the largest catchment of demand When practitioners confuse the two they all too often are driven to look for customer differences for niche markets in the existing industry space rather than the commonalities that cut across buyer groups in search of blue oceans of new demand Red Ocean Trap Nine The belief that blue ocean strategy sees competition as bad when in fact it can be good for companies Blue ocean strategy does not see competition as bad However unlike traditional economic thought it does not see competition as always good Historically economists argued that absent competition companies have no incentive to improve their product or service but with competition companies are pushed to up their game lower their prices and improve their products and services At the level of the firm however competition is only good up to a point When supply exceeds demand as it does in an increasing array of industries the intensity of competition tends to have deleterious effects on the profitable growth of organizations as more and more firms fight to win a slice of a given pool of customers triggering intense price pressure razorthin margins commoditization of offerings and slower growth If companies continue to compete further to grab a bigger share of the existing pie without expanding it or creating a new one such competitive actions are bound to produce negative economic consequences for firms This is why blue ocean strategy argues that firms need to go beyond competing and the mere improvement of product or services in overcrowded industries and pursue value innovation to open up new market space and make the competition irrelevant Hence while understanding how to compete in existing market space is important blue ocean strategy addresses the critical challenge of how to redefine industry boundaries and create new market space when structural conditions work against you This is how blue ocean strategy deals with competition to produce continuous renewal and the growth of industries Red Ocean Trap Ten The belief that blue ocean strategy is synonymous with creative destruction or disruption Creative destruction or disruption occurs when an innovation disrupts an existing market by displacing an earlier technology or existing product or service The word displacement is important here as without displacement disruption would not occur In the case of photography for example the innovation of digital photography disrupted the photographic film industry by effectively displacing it So today digital photography is the norm and photographic film is seldom used Disruption is hence largely consonant with Schumpeters concept of creative destruction whereby the old is incessantly destroyed or replaced by the new Unlike disruption however blue ocean strategy does not necessitate displacement or destruction Blue ocean strategy is a broader concept that goes beyond creative destruction to embrace nondestructive creation which is its overriding emphasis Take Viagra which created a blue ocean in lifestyle drugs Did Viagra effectively disrupt an existing industry by displacing an earlier technology or existing product or service No It created a blue ocean via nondestructive creation By reconstructing existing market boundaries blue ocean strategy creates new market space within and beyond existing industries When new market space is created beyond existing industry boundaries as with Viagra reconstruction tends to bring about nondestructive creation When on the other hand new market space is created within an existing industry like disruptive innovation displacement tends to occur However in many cases even when the reconstruction occurs within industries blue ocean strategy also produces nondestructive creation Nintendos Wii for example created a blue ocean in the video game industry It had an element of creative destruction However the new market space it created of physically active familycentered video gaming had an even larger element of nondestructive creation that complemented more than disrupted or displaced existing video games The important question for practice is What drives blue ocean strategy to go beyond creative destruction to nondestructive creation which is a key goal of most companies as well as of governments in their quest to stimulate economic growth The essential point here is that blue ocean strategy is not about finding a better or lowercost solution to the existing problem of an industry both of which trigger disruption and displacement of existing products and services Instead blue ocean strategy is about redefining the problem itself which tends to create new demand or an offering that often complements rather than displaces existing products and services The six paths framework in chapter 3 is critical in this regard as it provides systematic ways to redefine industry problems to open up new market space To put the ideas and methodologies contained in this book into proper practice you need to have a robust understanding not only of the building blocks of blue ocean strategy but also of the assumptions that lurk behind the red ocean traps While some of these misconceptions are more conceptual than others they all matter if you are to use the blue ocean strategy tools and methodologies to achieve their intended objectives in practice This is why we felt the need to end this expanded edition by clarifying the red ocean traps Only then can we move one step closer to achieving our ultimate goal of bringing blue ocean strategy theory closer to practice APPENDIX A A Sketch of the Historical Pattern of Blue Ocean Creation AT THE RISK OF OVERSIMPLIFICATION here we present a snapshot overview of the history of three American industriesautomobiles computers and movie theatersfrom the perspective of major product and service offerings that opened new market space and generated significant new demand This review which spans the start of these industries until roughly 2005 intends to be neither comprehensive in its coverage nor exhaustive in its content Its aim is limited to identifying the common strategic elements across key blue ocean offerings US industries are chosen here because they represent the largest and least regulated free market during our study period Although the review is only a sketch of the historical pattern of blue ocean creation several patterns stand out across these three representative industries There is no permanently excellent industry The attractiveness of all industries rose and fell over the study period There are no permanently excellent companies Companies like industries rose and fell over time These first two findings both confirm and add further evidence that permanently excellent companies and industries do not exist A key determinant of whether an industry or a company was on a rising trajectory of strong profitable growth was the strategic move of blue ocean creation The creation of blue oceans was a key catalyst in setting an industry on an upward growth and profit trajectory It was also a pivotal determinant driving a companys rise in profitable growth as well as its fall when another company gained the lead and created a new blue ocean Blue oceans were created by both industry incumbents and new entrants challenging the lore that startups have natural advantages over established companies in creating new market space Moreover the blue oceans created by incumbents were usually within their core businesses In fact most blue oceans are created from within not beyond red oceans of existing boundaries Issues of perceived cannibalization or creative destruction for established companies proved to be exaggerated1 Blue oceans created profitable growth for every company launching them startups and incumbents alike The creation of blue oceans was not about technology innovation per se Sometimes leadingedge technology was present but often it was not a defining feature of blue oceans This was true even when the industry under examination was technology intensive such as computers Rather the key defining feature of blue oceans was value innovationinnovation that was linked to what buyers value The creation of blue oceans did more than contribute to strong profitable growth this strategic move exercised a strong positive effect on establishing a companys standing brand name in buyers minds Lets now turn to these three representative industries to let the history of blue ocean creation speak for itself Here we begin with the auto industry a central form of transportation in the developed world The Automobile Industry The US auto industry dates back to 1893 when the Duryea brothers launched the first onecylinder auto in the United States At the time the horse and buggy was the primary means of US transportation Soon after the autos US debut there were hundreds of auto manufacturers building custommade automobiles in the country The autos of the time were a luxurious novelty One model even offered electric curlers in the backseat for onthego primping They were unreliable and expensive costing around 1500 twice the average annual family income And they were enormously unpopular Anticar activists tore up roads ringed parked cars with barbed wire and organized boycotts of cardriving businessmen and politicians Public resentment of the automobile was so great that even future president Woodrow Wilson weighed in saying Nothing has spread socialistic feeling more than the automobile a picture of the arrogance of wealth2 Literary Digest suggested The ordinary horseless carriage is at present a luxury for the wealthy and although its price will probably fall in the future it will never of course come into as common use as the bicycle3 The industry in short was small and unattractive Henry Ford however didnt believe it had to be this way The Model T In 1908 while Americas five hundred automakers built custommade novelty automobiles Henry Ford introduced the Model T He called it the car for the great multitude constructed of the best materials Although it came in only one color black and one model the Model T was reliable durable and easy to fix And it was priced so that the majority of Americans could afford one In 1908 the first Model T cost 850 half the price of existing automobiles In 1909 it dropped to 609 and by 1924 it was down to 2904 In comparison the price of a horsedriven carriage the cars closest alternative at the time was around 400 A 1909 sales brochure proclaimed Watch the Ford Go By High Priced Quality in a Low Priced Car Fords success was underpinned by a profitable business model By keeping the cars highly standardized and offering limited options and interchangeable parts Fords revolutionary assembly line replaced skilled craftsmen with ordinary unskilled laborers who worked one small task faster and more efficiently cutting the time to make a Model T from twentyone days to four days and cutting labor hours by 60 percent5 With lower costs Ford was able to charge a price that was accessible to the mass market Sales of the Model T exploded Fords market share surged from 9 percent in 1908 to 61 percent in 1921 and by 1923 a majority of American households owned an automobile6 Fords Model T exploded the size of the automobile industry creating a huge blue ocean So great was the blue ocean Ford created that the Model T replaced the horsedrawn carriage as the primary means of transport in the United States General Motors By 1924 the car had become an essential household item and the wealth of the average American household had grown That year General Motors GM unveiled a line of automobiles that would create a new blue ocean in the auto industry In contrast to Fords functional onecolor singlemodel strategy GM introduced a car for every purse and purposea strategy devised by chairman Alfred Sloan to appeal to the emotional dimensions of the US mass market or what Sloan called the massclass market7 Whereas Ford stuck with the functional horseless carriage concept of the car GM made the car fun exciting comfortable and fashionable GM factories pumped out a broad array of models with new colors and styles updated every year The annual car model created new demand as buyers began to trade up for fashion and comfort Because cars were replaced more frequently the used car market was also formed Demand for GMs fashionable and emotionally charged cars soared From 1926 to 1950 the total number of cars sold in the United States increased from two million to seven million a year and General Motors increased its overall market share from 20 percent to 50 percent while Fords fell from 50 percent to 20 percent8 But the rapid growth in the US auto industry unleashed by this new blue ocean could not last forever Following GMs surging success Ford and Chrysler jumped into the blue ocean GM had created and the Big Three pursued the common strategy of launching new car models yearly and hitting an emotional chord with consumers by building a wide range of car styles to meet various lifestyles and needs Slowly bloody competition began as the Big Three imitated and matched one anothers strategies Collectively they captured more than 90 percent of the US auto market9 A period of complacency set in Small FuelEfficient Japanese Cars The auto industry however did not stand still In the 1970s the Japanese created a new blue ocean challenging the US automobile industry with small efficient cars Instead of following the implicit industry logic the bigger the better and focusing on luxuries the Japanese altered the conventional logic pursuing ruthless quality small size and the new utility of highly gasefficient cars When the oil crisis occurred in the 1970s US consumers flocked to fuel efficient robust Japanese cars made by Honda Toyota and Nissan then called Datsun Almost overnight the Japanese became heroes in consumers minds Their compact fuelefficient cars created a new blue ocean of opportunity and again demand soared With the Big Three focused on benchmarking and matching one another none had taken the initiative to produce functional compact fuelefficient cars even though they did see the market potential for such vehicles Hence instead of creating a new blue ocean the Big Three were dragged into a new round of competitive benchmarking only this time with the Japanese they began to invest heavily in the production of smaller fuelefficient vehicles Nevertheless the Big Three were still hit by a dive in car sales with aggregate losses amounting to 4 billion in 198010 Chrysler the little brother among the Big Three suffered the hardest hit and narrowly escaped bankruptcy by virtue of a government bailout The Japanese car producers had been so effective at creating and capturing this blue ocean that the US automakers found it hard to make a real comeback their competitiveness and longrun viability were thrown into serious question by industry experts across the world Chryslers Minivan Fastforward to 1984 A beleaguered Chrysler on the edge of bankruptcy unveiled the minivan creating a new blue ocean in the auto industry The minivan broke the boundary between car and van creating an entirely new type of vehicle Smaller than the traditional van and yet more spacious than the station wagon the minivan was exactly what the nuclear family needed to hold the entire family plus its bikes dogs and other necessities And the minivan was easier to drive than a truck or van Built on the Chrysler K car chassis the minivan drove like a car but provided more interior room and could still fit in the family garage Chrysler however was not the first to work on this concept Ford and GM had had the minivan on their drawing boards for years but they had worried that the design would cannibalize their own station wagons Undoubtedly they passed a golden opportunity to Chrysler Within its first year the minivan became Chryslers bestselling vehicle helping the company regain its position as one of the Big Three auto manufacturers Within three years Chrysler gained 15 billion from the minivans introduction alone11 The success of the minivan ignited the sports utility vehicle SUV boom in the 1990s which expanded the blue ocean Chrysler had unlocked Built on a truck chassis the SUV continued the progression from car to utility truck First designed for offroad driving and towing boat trailers the SUV became wildly popular with young families for its carlike handling increased passenger and cargo space over the minivan and comfortable interiors combined with the increased functionality of fourwheel drive towing capabilities and safety By 1998 total sales of new light trucks minivans SUVs and pickups reached 75 million nearly matching the 82 million new car sales12 And by 2005 total sales of new light trucks reached 93 million going much beyond the 77 million sales of new cars13 In assessing the US auto industry from its inception until 2005 we see that GM the Japanese automakers and Chrysler were established players when they created blue oceans For the most part the blue oceans that were created were not triggered by technological innovations Even Fords revolutionary assembly line can be traced to the US meatpacking industry14 The attractiveness of the auto industry was continuously rising and falling and rising again driven to no small extent by blue ocean strategic moves The same is true for the profitable growth trends of companies in the industry Companies profit and growth were linked in no small way to the blue oceans they created or failed to create Almost all these companies are remembered for the blue oceans they have created across time Ford for example has suffered significantly at times but its brand still stands out largely for the Model T it created some one hundred years ago The Computer Industry Lets now turn to the computer industry which supplies a central component of work environments across the globe The US computer industry traces back to 1890 when Herman Hollerith invented the punch card tabulating machine to shorten the process of data recording and analysis for the US census Holleriths tabulator completed the census tabulations five years sooner than the preceding census Soon after Hollerith left the census office to form Tabulating Machine Company TMC which sold its tabulators to US and foreign government agencies At the time there was no real market for Holleriths tabulators in business settings where data processing was accomplished with pencils and ledgers that were easy to use inexpensive and accurate Although Holleriths tabulator was very fast and accurate it was expensive and difficult to use and it required continuous upkeep Facing new competition after the expiration of his patent and frustrated after the US government dropped TMC due to its steep prices Hollerith sold the company which was then merged with two other companies to form CTR in 1911 The Tabulating Machine In 1914 CTRs tabulating business remained small and unprofitable In an attempt to turn the company around CTR turned to Thomas Watson a former executive at National Cash Register Company for help Watson recognized that there was enormous untapped demand for tabulators to help businesses improve their inventory and accounting practices Yet he also realized that the cumbersome new technology was too expensive and complicated for businesses when their pencils and ledgers worked just fine In a strategic move that would launch the computer industry Watson combined the strengths of the tabulator with the ease and lower costs of pencils and ledgers Under Watson CTRs tabulators were simplified and modularized and the company began to offer onsite maintenance and user education and oversight Customers would get the speed and efficiency of the tabulator without the need to hire specialists to train employees or technicians to fix the machines when they broke down Next Watson decreed that tabulators would be leased and not sold an innovation that helped establish a new pricing model for the tabulating machine business On the one hand it allowed businesses to avoid large capital expenditures while giving them the flexibility to upgrade as tabulators improved On the other hand it gave CTR a recurring revenue stream while precluding customers from buying used machines from one another Within six years the firms revenues more than tripled15 By the mid 1920s CTR held 85 percent of the tabulating market in the United States In 1924 to reflect the companys growing international presence Watson changed CTRs name to International Business Machines Corp IBM The blue ocean of tabulators was unlocked The Electronic Computer Skip ahead thirty years to 1952 Remington Rand delivered the UNIVAC the worlds first commercial electronic computer to the census bureau Yet that year only three UNIVACs were sold A blue ocean was not in sight until IBMs Watsonthis time his son Thomas Watson Jrwould see the untapped demand in what looked like a small lackluster market Watson Jr realized the role electronic computers could play in business and pushed IBM to meet the challenge In 1953 IBM introduced the IBM 650 the first intermediatesized computer for business use Recognizing that if businesses were going to use the electronic computer they wouldnt want a complicated machine and would pay only for the computing power they would use IBM had made the IBM 650 much simpler to use and less powerful than the UNIVAC and it priced the machine at only 200000 compared with the UNIVACs 1 million price tag As a result by the end of the 1950s IBM had captured 85 percent of the business electronic computer market Revenues almost tripled between 1952 and 1959 from 412 million to 116 billion16 IBMs expansion of the blue ocean was greatly accentuated in 1964 with the introduction of the System360 the first large family of computers to use interchangeable software peripheral equipment and service packages It was a bold departure from the monolithic onesizefitsall mainframe Later in 1969 IBM changed the way computers were sold Rather than offer hardware services and software exclusively in packages IBM unbundled the components and offered them for sale individually Unbundling gave birth to the multibilliondollar software and services industries with IBM becoming the worlds largest computer services company The Personal Computer The computer industry continued its evolution through the 1960s and 1970s IBM Digital Equipment Corporation DEC Sperry and others that had jumped into the computer industry expanded operations globally and improved and extended product lines to add peripherals and service markets Yet in 1978 when the major computer manufacturers were intent on building bigger more powerful machines for the business market Apple Computer Inc created an entirely new market space with its Apple II home computer However contrary to conventional wisdom the Apple was not the first personal computer on the market Two years earlier Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems MITS had unveiled the Altair 8800 The Altair was released with high expectations in computer hobbyist circles BusinessWeek quickly called MITS the IBM of home computers Yet MITS did not create a blue ocean Why The machine had no monitor no permanent memory only 256 characters of temporary memory no software and no keyboard To enter data users manipulated switches on the front of the box and program results were displayed in a pattern of flashing lights on the front panel Unsurprisingly no one saw much of a market for such difficulttouse home computers Expectations were so low that in that same year Ken Olsen president of Digital Equipment famously said There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in their home Two years later the Apple II would make Olsen eat his words creating a blue ocean of home computing Based largely on existing technology the Apple II offered a solution with an allinone design in a plastic casing including the keyboard power supply and graphics that was easy to use The Apple II came with software ranging from games to businesses programs such as the Apple Writer word processor and the VisiCalc spreadsheet making the computer accessible to the mass of buyers Apple changed the way people thought about computers Computers were no longer products for technological geeks they became like the Model T before them a staple of the American household Only two years after the birth of the Apple II Apple sales were more than 200000 units a year with Apple placed on the Fortune 500 list three years after going public an unprecedented feat at the time17 In 1980 some two dozen firms sold 724000 personal computers bringing in more than 18 billion18 By the next year twenty other companies entered the market and sales doubled to 14 million units racking in almost 3 billion19 Like a stalking horse IBM waited out the first couple of years to study the market and the technology and to plan the launch of its home computer In 1982 IBM dramatically expanded the blue ocean of home computing by offering a far more open architecture that allowed other parties to write software and develop peripherals By offering a standardized operating system for which outsiders could create the software and peripheral components IBM was able to keep its cost and price low while offering customers greater utility The companys scale and scope advantages allowed it to price its PC at a level accessible to the mass of buyers20 During its first year IBM sold 200000 PCs nearly matching its fiveyear projection by 1983 consumers had bought 13 million IBM PCs21 Compaq PC Servers With corporations across the United States buying and installing PCs throughout their organizations there was a growing need to connect PCs for simple but important tasks such as sharing files and printers The business computer industry spawned by the IBM 650and jumped into by HP DEC and Sequent to name a fewoffered highend enterprise systems to run corporations critical missions as well as numerous operating systems and application software But these machines were too expensive and complex to justify handling simple but important needs such as file and printer sharing This was especially true in small to midsize companies that needed to share printers and files but did not yet require the huge investment of a complex minicomputer architecture In 1992 Compaq changed all that by effectively creating the blue ocean of the PC server industry with its launch of the ProSignia a radically simplified server that was optimized for the most commonly used functions of file and printer sharing It eliminated interoperability with a host of operating systems ranging from SCO UNIX to OS3 to DOS which were extraneous to these basic functions The new PC server gave buyers twice a minicomputers file and print sharing capability and speed at onethird the price As for Compaq the dramatically simplified machines translated into much lower manufacturing costs Compaqs creation of the ProSignia and three subsequent offerings in the PC server industry not only fueled PC sales but also grew the PC server industry into a 38 billion industry in less than four years22 Dell Computer In the mid1990s Dell Computer Corporation created another blue ocean in the computer industry Traditionally computer manufacturers competed on offering faster computers having more features and software Dell however challenged this industry logic by changing the purchasing and delivery experiences of buyers With its direct sales to customers Dell was able to sell its PCs for 40 percent less than IBM dealers while still making money Direct sales further appealed to customers because Dell offered unprecedented delivery time For example the time it took from order to customer delivery at Dell was four days compared with its competitors average of more than ten weeks Moreover through Dells online and telephone ordering system customers were given the option to customize their machines to their liking In the meantime the builttoorder model allowed Dell to significantly reduce inventory costs With Dells blue ocean it became the undisputed market leader in PC sales Its revenues skyrocketed from 53 billion in 1995 to 43 billion in 200623 Since then new blue oceans have continued to be created in the computer industry from the tablet with Apples iPad to cloud computing services leapfrogging Dell To remain relevant Dells challenge is to create a new blue ocean to capture the imagination and wallets of buyers again Without this it will be hard for Dell to get out of the red ocean of bloody competition it now finds itself in As with the auto industry the blue oceans in the computer industry have not been unleashed by technology innovations per se but by linking technology to elements valued by buyers As in the case of the IBM 650 and the Compaq PC server the value innovation often rested on simplifying the technology We also see industry incumbentsCTR IBM Compaq launching blue oceans as much as we see new entrants such as Apple and Dell Each blue ocean has gone a long way to enhance the originating companys brand name and has led to a surge not only in its profitable growth but in the profitable growth of the computer industry overall The Movie Theater Industry Now lets turn to the movie theater industry which offers a way for many of us to relax after work or on weekends The US movie theater industry can be traced back to 1893 when Thomas Edison unveiled the Kinetoscope a wooden cabinet inside which light was projected through a reel of film Viewers saw the action through a peephole one at a time and the performance was called a peep show Two years later Edisons staff developed a projecting kinetoscope which showed motion pictures on a screen The projecting kinetoscope however did not take off in any meaningful way The clips each several minutes long were introduced between vaudeville acts and at theaters The aim was to lift the value of live entertainment performances the focus of the theater industry rather than to provide a discrete entertainment form The technology was there for the movie theater industry to ignite but the idea to create a blue ocean had not yet been planted Nickelodeons Harry Davis changed all that by opening his first nickelodeon theater in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in 1905 The nickelodeon is widely credited with launching the movie theater industry in the United States creating a huge blue ocean Consider the differences Although most Americans belonged to the working class at the beginning of the twentieth century the theater industry until then concentrated on offering live entertainment such as theater operas and vaudeville to the social elite With the average family earning only 12 a week live entertainment simply wasnt an option It was too expensive Average ticket prices for an opera were 2 and vaudeville was 50 cents For the majority theater was too serious With little education the theater or opera just wasnt appealing to the working class It was also inconvenient Productions played only a few times a week and with most theaters located in the wellheeled parts of the city they were difficult to get to for the mass of workingclass people When it came to entertainment most Americans were left in the dark In contrast the price of admission to Daviss nickelodeon theater was 5 cents thus explaining the name Davis kept the price at a nickel by stripping the theater venue to its bare essentialsbenches and the screen and placing his theaters in lowerrent workingclass neighborhoods Next he focused on volume and convenience opening his theaters at eight in the morning and playing reels continuously until midnight The nickelodeons were fun playing slapstick comedies accessible to most people regardless of their education language or age Workingclass people flocked to nickelodeons which entertained some seven thousand customers per day In 1907 the Saturday Evening Post reported that daily attendance at nickelodeons exceeded two million24 Soon nickelodeons set up shop across the country By 1914 the United States had eighteen thousand nickelodeons with seven million daily admissions25 The blue ocean had grown into a 3 billion industry in todays dollar terms The Palace Theaters As the nickelodeons blue ocean reached its peak in 1914 Samuel Roxy Rothapfel set out to bring the appeal of motion pictures to the emerging middle and upper classes by opening the countrys first Palace Theater in New York City Until that point Rothapfel had owned a number of nickelodeons in the United States and was best known for turning around struggling theaters across the country Unlike nickelodeons which were considered lowbrow and simplistic Rothapfels Palace Theaters were elaborate affairs with extravagant chandeliers mirrored hallways and grand entranceways With valet parking plush love seats and longer films with theatrical plots these theaters made going to the movies an event worthy of theateror operagoers but at an affordable price The picture palaces were a commercial success Between 1914 and 1922 four thousand new Palace Theaters opened in the United States Moviegoing became an increasingly important entertainment event for Americans of all economic levels As Roxy pointed out Giving the people what they want is fundamentally and disastrously wrong The people dont know what they want Give them something better Palace Theaters effectively combined the viewing environment of opera houses with the viewing contents of nickelodeonsfilmsto unlock a new blue ocean in the cinema industry and attract a whole new mass of moviegoers the upper and middle classes26 As the wealth of the nation increased and Americans headed for the suburbs to fulfill the dream of a house with a picket fence a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage the limitations of further growth in the Palace Theater concept began to be felt in the late 1940s Suburbs unlike major cities or metropolitan areas could not support the large size and opulent interiors of the Palace Theater concept The result of competitive evolution was the emergence of small theaters in suburban locations running one movie per week Although the small theaters were cost leaders compared with Palace Theaters they failed to capture peoples imaginations They gave people no special feeling of a night out and their success depended solely on the quality of the film being played If a film was unsuccessful customers saw no reason to come and the theater owner lost money With the industry increasingly taking on a hasbeen status its profitable growth was flagging The Multiplex Yet once again the industry was set on a new profitable growth trajectory through the creation of a new blue ocean In 1963 Stan Durwood undertook a strategic move that turned the industry on its head Durwoods father had opened his familys first movie theater in Kansas City in the 1920s and Stan Durwood revitalized the movie theater industry with the creation of the first multiplex in a Kansas City shopping center The multiplex was an instant hit On the one hand the multiplex gave viewers a greater choice of films on the other with differentsized theaters in one place theater owners could make adjustments to meet varying demands for movies thereby spreading their risk and keeping costs down As a result Durwoods company American MultiCinema Inc AMC grew from a smalltown theater to become the secondlargest movie company in the nation as the blue ocean of the multiplex spread across America The Megaplex The launch of the multiplex created a blue ocean of new profitable growth in the industry but by the 1980s the spread of videocassette recorders and satellite and cable television had reduced movie attendance To make matters worse in an attempt to capture a greater share of a shrinking market theater owners split their theaters into smaller and smaller viewing rooms so that they could show more features Unwittingly they undermined one of the industrys distinctive strengths over home entertainment large screens With firstrun movies available on cable and videocassette only weeks after release the benefit of paying more money to see movies on a slightly larger screen was marginal The movie theater industry fell into a steep decline In 1995 AMC again recreated the movie theater industry by introducing the first twentyfourscreen megaplex in the United States Unlike the multiplexes which were often cramped dingy and unspectacular the megaplex had stadium seating for unobstructed views and comfortable easy chairs and it offered more films and superior sight and sound Despite these improved offerings the megaplexs operating costs are still lower than the multiplexs This is because the megaplexs location outside city centers the key cost factoris much cheaper its size gives it economies in purchasing and operations and more leverage with film distributors And with twentyfour screens playing every available movie on the market the place and not the movie becomes the draw In the late 1990s average percustomer revenues at AMC megaplexes were 88 percent above those of the average multiplex theater The cinema clearance zones of movie theatersthe radius of the area from which people will come to the cinemajumped from two miles in the mid1990s to five miles for AMCs megaplex27 Between 1995 and 2001 overall motion picture attendance grew from 126 billion to 149 billion Megaplexes constituted only 15 percent of US movie screens but they accounted for 38 percent of all boxoffice revenues The success of the blue ocean created by AMC caused other industry players to imitate it Too many megaplexes were built in too short a time however and many of them had closed by 2000 because of a slowing economy Again the industry is ripe for a new blue ocean to be created People love to go out and generally enjoy being entertained With the increasing prevalence of easily downloadable films from the likes of Netflix iTunes and Amazon the pressure is on for movie theaters to once again reinvent themselves to recapture peoples love for an enjoyable entertainment experience This is only a sketch of the American movie theater industry but the same general patterns appear as in the other examples This has not been a perpetually attractive industry There has not been a perpetually excellent company The creation of blue oceans has been a key driving factor in a companys and the industrys profitable growth trajectory with blue oceans being created here mainly by incumbents such as AMC and Palace Theaters As history reveals AMC created a blue ocean in the US movie theater industry first with the multiplex and then with megaplex twice resetting the course of development for the entire industry and twice bringing its own profitability and growth to a new level At the heart of these blue oceans was not technology innovation per se but valuedriven innovation what we call value innovation Looking across the sketches of these three industries we find that whether or not a company can attain sustained profitable growth depends largely on whether it can continuously stay in the forefront during consecutive rounds of blue ocean creation Lasting excellence has scarcely been achievable for any company to date no company has been able to lead journeys into blue oceans continuously over the long run However companies with powerful names are often those that have been capable of reinventing themselves by repeatedly creating new market space In this sense there have been no perpetually excellent companies up until now but companies can hope to maintain excellence by adhering to excellent strategic practice With marginal deviations the pattern of blue ocean creation exemplified by these three representative industries is consistent with what we observed in the other industries in our study By articulating the logic of blue ocean strategy and providing systematic tools and frameworks to act on this book aims to help alter business history by making the creation of blue oceans a systematic process that is repeatable APPENDIX B Value Innovation A Reconstructionist View of Strategy THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO DISTINCT VIEWS on how industry structure is related to strategic actions of industrial players The structuralist view of strategy has its roots in industrial organization IO economics1 The model of industrial organization analysis proposes a structureconductperformance paradigm which suggests a causal flow from market structure to conduct and performance Market structure given by supply and demand conditions shapes sellers and buyers conduct which in turn determines end performance2 Systemwide changes are induced by factors that are external to the market structure such as fundamental changes in basic economic conditions and technological breakthroughs3 The reconstructionist view of strategy on the other hand is built on the theory of endogenous growth The theory traces back to Joseph A Schumpeters initial observation that the forces that change economic structure and industry landscapes can come from within the system4 Schumpeter argues that innovation can happen endogenously and that its main source is the creative entrepreneur5 Schumpeterian innovation is still blackboxed however because it is the product of the ingenuity of entrepreneurs and cannot be reproduced systematically Schumpeterian innovation also assumes destruction in that it sees the new incessantly destroying the old More recently the new growth theory made advances on this front by showing that innovation can be replicable endogenously via an understanding of the patterns or recipes behind innovation6 In essence this theoretical advancement separated the recipe for innovationor the pattern of knowledge and ideas behind itfrom Schumpeters lone entrepreneur opening the way for the systematic reproduction of innovation However despite this important advance we still lack an understanding of what those recipes or patterns are Absent this knowledge and ideas cannot be deployed in action to produce innovation and growth at the firm level The reconstructionist view takes off where the new growth theory left off Building on the new growth theory the reconstructionist view suggests how knowledge and ideas are deployed in the process of creation to produce endogenous growth for the firm In particular it proposes that such a process of creation can occur in any organization at any time by the cognitive reconstruction of existing data and market elements in a fundamentally new way These two viewsthe structuralist and the reconstructionisthave important implications for how companies act on strategy The structuralist view or environmental determinism often leads to competitionbased strategic thinking Taking market structure as given it drives companies to try to carve out a defensible position against the competition in the existing market space To sustain themselves in the marketplace practitioners of strategy focus on building advantages over the competition usually by assessing what competitors do and striving to do it better Here grabbing a bigger share of the market is seen as a zerosum game in which one companys gain is achieved at another companys loss Hence competition the supply side of the equation becomes the defining variable of strategy Such strategic thinking leads firms to divide industries into attractive and unattractive ones and to decide accordingly whether or not to enter After it is in an industry a firm chooses a distinctive cost or differentiation position that best matches its internal systems and capabilities to counter the competition7 Here cost and value are seen as tradeoffs Because the total profit level of the industry is also determined exogenously by structural factors firms principally seek to capture and redistribute wealth instead of creating wealth They focus on dividing up the red ocean where growth is increasingly limited To reconstructionist eyes however the strategic challenge looks very different Recognizing that structure and market boundaries exist only in managers minds practitioners who hold this view do not let existing market structures limit their thinking To them extra demand is out there largely untapped The crux of the problem is how to create it This in turn requires a shift of attention from supply to demand from a focus on competing to a focus on value innovationthat is the creation of innovative value to unlock new demand With this new focus in mind firms can hope to accomplish the journey of discovery by looking systematically across established boundaries of competition and reordering existing elements in different markets to reconstruct them into a new market space where a new level of demand is generated8 In the reconstructionist view there is scarcely any attractive or unattractive industry per se because the level of industry attractiveness can be altered through companies conscientious efforts of reconstruction As market structure is changed in the reconstruction process so are best practice rules of the game Competition in the old game is therefore rendered irrelevant By stimulating the demand side of the economy the strategy of value innovation expands existing markets and creates new ones Value innovators achieve a leap in value by creating new wealth rather than necessarily at the expense of competitors in the traditional sense In this way value innovation goes beyond creative destruction that displaces and hence destructs the players in existing markets It also brings nondestructive creation through which it either expands the existing market boundaries or creates new market spaces Such a strategy therefore allows firms to largely play a non zerosum game with high payoff possibilities How then does reconstruction such as what we see in Cirque du Soleil differ from the combination and recombination that have been discussed in the innovation literature9 Schumpeter for example sees innovation as a new combination of productive means We have seen in the example of Cirque du Soleil a focus on the demand side whereas recombination is about recombining existing technologies or productive means often focusing on the supply side The basic building blocks for reconstruction are buyer value elements that reside across existing industry boundaries They are not technologies nor methods of production By focusing on the supply side recombination tends to seek an innovative solution to the existing problem which when achieved leads to displacement and hence creative destruction Looking at the demand side in contrast reconstruction breaks away from the cognitive bounds set by the existing rules of competition It focuses on redefining the existing problem itself which tends to produce creative destruction along with nondestructive creation10 Cirque du Soleil for example is not about offering a better circus by recombining existing knowledge or technologies about acts and performances Rather it is about reconstructing existing buyer value elements to create a new form of entertainment that offers the fun and thrill of the circus with the intellectual sophistication of the theater Reconstruction reshapes the boundary and the structure of an industry and creates a blue ocean of new market space Recombination on the other hand tends to maximize technological possibilities to discover innovative solutions to a given and known problem11 APPENDIX C The Market Dynamics of Value Innovation THE MARKET DYNAMICS OF VALUE INNOVATION stand in stark contrast with the conventional practice of technology innovation The latter typically sets high prices limits access and initially engages in price skimming to earn a premium on the innovation and only later focuses on lowering prices and costs to retain market share and discourage imitators However in a world of nonrival and nonexcludable goods such as knowledge and ideas that are imbued with the potential of economies of scale learning and increasing returns the importance of volume price and cost grows in an unprecedented way1 Under these conditions companies would do well to capture the mass of target buyers from the outset and expand the size of the market by offering radically superior value at price points accessible to them As shown in figure C1 value innovation radically increases the appeal of a good shifting the demand curve from D1 to D2 The price is set strategically and as with the Swatch example is shifted from P1 to P2 to capture the mass of buyers in the expanded market This increases the quantity sold from Q1 to Q2 and builds strong brand recognition for unprecedented value FIGURE C1 The market dynamics of value innovation The company however engages in target costing to simultaneously reduce the longrun average cost curve from LRAC1 to LRAC2 to expand its ability to profit and to discourage free riding and imitation Hence buyers receive a leap in value shifting the consumer surplus from axb to eyf And the company earns a leap in profit and growth shifting the profit zone from abcd to efgh The rapid brand recognition built by the company as a result of the unprecedented value offered in the marketplace combined with the simultaneous drive to lower costs makes the competition nearly irrelevant and makes it hard to catch up as economies of scale learning and increasing returns kick in2 What follows is the emergence of winwin market dynamics where companies earn dominant positions while buyers also come out big winners Traditionally firms with monopolistic positions have been associated with two social welfare loss activities First to maximize their profits companies set prices high This prohibits those customers who although desiring the product cannot afford to buy it Second lacking viable competition firms with monopolistic positions often do not focus on efficiency and cost reduction and hence consume more scarce resources As figure C2 shows under conventional monopolistic practice the price level is raised from P1 under perfect competition to P2 under monopoly Consequently demand drops from Q1 to Q2 At this level of demand the monopolist increases its profits by the area R as opposed to the situation of perfect competition Because of the artificially high price imposed on consumers the consumer surplus decreases from area CRD to area C Meanwhile the monopolistic practice by consuming more of the societys resources also incurs a deadweight loss of area D for the society at large Monopolistic profits therefore are achieved at the expense of consumers and society at large FIGURE C2 From perfect competition to monopolist practice Blue ocean strategy on the other hand works against this sort of price skimming which is common to traditional monopolists The focus of blue ocean strategy is not on restricting output at a high price but rather on creating new aggregate demand through a leap in buyer value at an accessible price This creates a strong incentive not only to reduce costs to the lowest possible level at the start but also to keep it that way over time to discourage potential freeriding imitators In this way buyers win and the society benefits from improved efficiency This creates a winwin scenario A breakthrough in value is achieved

Harrison C White 1981 and Joseph Porac and Jos Antonio Rosa 1996 2 Gary Hamel and C K Prahalad 1994 and James Moore 1996 observed that competition is intensifying and commoditization of business is accelerating two trends that make market creation essential if firms are to grow 3 Ever since the groundbreaking work of Michael Porter 1980 1985 competition has occupied the center of strategic thinking See also Paul Auerbach 1988 and George S Day et al 1997 4 See for example Hamel and Prahalad 1994 5 See Standard Industrial Classification Manual 1987 and North American Industry

Kaplan 2001 16 Peter Drucker 1985 observes that companies tend to race against each other by looking at what competitors do 17 Kim and Mauborgne 1997a 1997c 1997d argue that a focus on benchmarking and beating the competition leads to imitative not innovative approaches to the market often resulting in price pressure and further commoditization Instead they argue companies should strive to make the competition irrelevant by offering buyers a leap in value Gary Hamel 1998 argues that success for both newcomers and industry incumbents hinges upon the capacity to avoid the competition and to reconceive the existing industry model He further argues 2000 that the formula for success is not to position against the competition but rather to go around it 18 Value creation as a concept of strategy is too broad because no boundary condition specifies how value should be created A company could create value for example simply by lowering costs by 2 percent Although this is indeed value creation it is hardly the value innovation that is needed to open new market space Although you can create value by simply doing similar things in an improved way you cannot create value innovation without stopping old things doing new things or doing similar things in a fundamentally new way Our research shows that given the strategic objective of value creation companies tend to focus on making incremental improvements at the margin Although value creation on an incremental scale does create some value it is not sufficient to make a company stand out in the crowd and achieve high performance 19 For examples of market pioneering that shoots beyond what buyers are ready to accept and pay for see Gerard J Tellis and Peter N Golder 2002 In their decadelong study they observe that fewer than 10 percent of market pioneers became business winners with more than 90 percent turning out to be business losers 20 For previous studies that challenged this dogma see for example Charles W L Hill 1988 as well as R E White 1986 21 For discussions on the necessity to choose between differentiation and low cost see Porter 1980 1985 Porter 1996 uses a productivity frontier curve to illustrate the valuecost tradeoff 22 Our studies revealed that value innovation is about redefining the problem an industry focuses on rather than finding solutions to existing problems 23 For discussions on what strategy is and is not see Porter 1996 He argues that although strategy should embrace the entire system of activities a firm performs operational improvements can occur at the subsystem level 24 Ibid Hence innovations that happen at the subsystem level are not strategy 25 Joe S Bain is a forerunner of the structuralist view See Bain 1956 1959 26 Although in different contexts venturing into the new has been observed to be a risky enterprise Steven P Schnaars 1994 for example observes that market pioneers occupy a disadvantaged position visvis their imitators Chris Zook 2004 argues that diversification away from a companys core business is risky and has low odds of success 27 Inga S Baird and Howard Thomas 1990 argue for example that any strategic decision involves risk taking Chapter 2 1 Alternatives go beyond substitutes A restaurant for example is an alternative to the cinema It competes for potential buyers who want to enjoy a night out even though it is neither a direct competitor nor a substitute for the cinema in its functional offering There are three tiers of noncustomers a company can look to For more detailed discussions on alternatives

growth potential triggered McDonalds to buy a 33 percent share of the company for 50 million After the McDonalds investment the company began to aggressively expand overseas But after a spectacular start losses quickly accumulated as Prets zealous expansion led it to take its eye off the ball After pruning back its overseas operations and getting back to the basics Pret turned around very quickly and went into steady sales growth with only a blip in the recession There is an important lesson here for companies that create a blue ocean While excitement in the market will be great and new demand for blue ocean offerings strong companies need to remain vigilant and not become lax or compromise their standards as they roll out their blue ocean offering 2 JCDecaux is also the worlds

Miller who was vice admiral of the US Navy at the time notes in his 2003 article The Joint Strike Fighter acquisition program began with early and sustained cooperation among government industry and the military and included designing with commonality among the services in mindwhich has kept costs downas well as plenty of testing The program is proving to be a model for success Relatedly in GasiorekNelsons 2003 article Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology Edward C Aldridge Jr speaking at the Defense Transformation Acquisition and Logistics Excellence Conference in 2003 is noted as saying that the Joint Strike Fighter now is a hugely successful international program 7 Given the almost tenyear time lag from the conception of the JSF F35 strategy to its planned realization in 2010 and the unusual high dependence on a complex web of external stakeholders outside of the militarys hierarchical control as we noted in our original book the conceptual strength of this strategic move does not in itself secure success Here execution challenges are very steep the key decision makers of the military and Pentagon changed during the tenyear realization time and external stakeholders had diverging interests and understandings Chapter 8 follows up the F35 and discusses how it evolved to date in the context of the execution issues involved with both internal and external stakeholders Chapter 6 1 Rohlfs 1974 was the first to define and discuss network externalities For a survey of work on this see Katz and Shapiro 1994 2 See Kenneth J Arrow 1962 and Paul Romer 1990 It is worth noting that both Arrow and Romer limited their discussion of nonrival and nonexcludable goods to technological innovations as is the tradition in economics When the concept of innovation is redefined as value innovation which is more relevant at the microeconomic firm level the importance of the nonrival and nonexcludable notion is even more striking This is because technological innovation often has a greater excludable component due to the possibility and relative ease of obtaining patent protection 3 See Ford Motor Company 1924 and William J Abernathy and Kenneth Wayne 1974 Chapter 7 1 Tipping point leadership traces its roots to the field of epidemiology and the theory of tipping points It hinges on the insight that in any organization fundamental changes can happen quickly when the beliefs and energies of a critical mass of people create an epidemic movement toward an idea The first application of the term tipping points to social behavior was in a 1957 study of racial segregation by Morton Grodzins 1957 and was more fully developed by University of Maryland economist Thomas Schelling 1978 Later Malcolm Gladwells book The Tipping Point 2000 popularized the notion and brought the term further into the common vernacular It is important to note however that our treatment of the theory of tipping points differs from Gladwells in important ways While Gladwell focuses on what triggers epidemics in societies we focus on leadership in the context of organizational transformation to understand how leaders can overcome the four key organizational hurdles identified in our research as central blocks to strategy execution As a result the fundamental drivers what we call disproportionate influence factors that our research identified as key to create organizational transformation fast at low cost differ from those of Gladwells mavens connectors and salespeople The two studies differ in both the context and the means to create epidemic change 2 See Joseph Ledoux 1998 and J S Morris et al 1998 3 See Baddely 1990 and Kolb 1983 4 See James Q Wilson and George L Kelling 1982 for a discussion on the theory of broken

Kim and Mauborgne 2009 2 The three strategy propositions correspond to the traditional activity system of an organization As the ultimate outputs of an organizations activities are value for the buyer and revenue for itself and its inputs are the costs to produce them and the people to deliver them the three strategy propositions of buyer value profit revenue minus costs and people capture the essence of what an organizations activity system does Unlike marketing manufacturing human resources and other functions a good strategy should cover the entire activity system of an organization A marketing department for example may focus on the value proposition and pay insufficient heed to the other two propositions Similarly a manufacturing department may neglect buyer needs or may treat people as a cost variable This is why a sustainable blue ocean strategy requires a fully developed and consistent set of three propositions Chapter 11 1 See Tellis and Golder 2002 Appendix A 1 For a

Only 10 percent mentioned the films R Koszarski 1990 And 24 percent of exhibitors surveyed in 1922 said that the quality of the feature film made absolutely no difference to success at the box office what mattered they said was the surrounding program ibid In fact cinema advertisements at the time tended to give as much print to the music as they did to the films With the introduction of sound technology in films in 1926 the importance of live music at the cinema a band or orchestra and the associated costs was dramatically reduced Palace Theaters with their elaborate dcor luxurious environment and services such as valet parking were well placed to take advantage of this shift for more than ten years until Americans began heading to smalltown suburbs in droves following World War

Loving the Crow Chapter 8 Heartbreak Resilience and the Path to Equanimity Chapter 9 Leadership and the Art of Growing Up Afterword A Light Heart Lives Long Authors Note Acknowledgments About the Author Endorsements Copyright About the Publisher Foreword I first met Jerry at a dinner party hosted by a mutual friend Jeff Walker It was the kind of dinner party at which a single topic was put to the entire group for discussion That night each of us was asked to describe a meaningful encounter with contemplative practice We listened quietly as the rotation went around the table Jerry was up before me and when he spoke he referred to a very difficult period in his life one in which a book called Faith which I had written was among the resources that had helped him The word faith as I had used it did not mean belief or doctrine or dogmaI saw faith as being about connection but our ability to connect to often hidden sources of strength within us and our ability to connect to a picture of life bigger than just the immediate circumstances we see before us By the time Jerry finished speaking he was crying and I was crying too It has always meant a lot to me when someone appreciates Faith Faith had been a difficult book for me to write It was the story of my own faith journey and it demanded revelations of my deepest heart values descriptions of my traumatic childhood memories of my most significant moments of despair and a vulnerability about things I somehow never found myself talking about ordinarily My guide throughout that experience had been a quotation from the writer Dorothy Allison Write the story that you were always afraid to tell I swear to you that there is magic in it and if you show yourself naked for me Ill be naked for you It will be our covenant Or as a writer friend of mine urged me one stuck day Just tell the truth Jerry and I became good friends and I was honored when he asked me to write this foreword As soon as I began reading Reboot Leadership and the Art of Growing Up I saw his authenticity compassion and almost eerie acuteness of perception leap right off the page I realized He really did tell the truth Thats what makes this book a generous and important offering Imbuing leadership with depth resolve congruency and resilienceas Jerry describes in the following pagesinevitably involves discovering the adult within us the capacity to face fears to care about ourselves and others in a rare and potent balance to be radically honest to inquire within and to listen to others We discover that adult capacity in all its poignancy and tenderness and we bring it into the light of day and we nurture it and help it to grow For most of us that capacity is often hidden in the shadows and not just hidden but intricately entangled with our persistent yet often hidden feelings of unworthiness our certainty of defeat our fragmentation our sense of isolation and emptiness and our sense of overwhelm coupled with our conviction that we can never rest Jerrys gift is in helping us navigate that landscapeto lean into that shadowy world and capture the treasures held there all the while learning to be both strong and kind to ourselves and to others If the book you are writing is asking honesty and clear discernment of the reader offering a path to a fulfilling and true and liberating life change then you cant write from a supercilious perch or make yourself immune to self revelation or imply that you have never struggled or had any difficulty perfectly manifesting the qualities you are talking about You could try of course but it would show What shows in contrast in Jerrys book is his own stripping away of armor or defensiveness or obfuscation I could sense the validity in the comment one of Jerrys friends had made to him Writing this book is gonna kick your butt I bet it did Actually I saw it did Thats the beauty of determining if you are really going to speak from the heart no imparting knowledge from on high no separation from the many dilemmas and yearnings for success and even anguish of your audience Its a powerful book and a truly useful one because Jerry kept that covenant He got naked He told the truth When Jerry first asked me to write the foreword I was honored but uncertain I asked Why not a mogul a famous business success He replied that this wasnt an ordinary business bookit reconfigures notions of success itself and ideas of who we are and what would make us happy It teaches us how above all things to be real The journey laid out is a path to equanimity or peace which is priceless The book is genuinely a transmission heart to heart Sharon Salzberg Dedication of the Merit May all beings enjoy happiness and the root of happiness May we be free from suffering and the root of suffering May we not be separated from the great happiness devoid of suffering May we dwell in the great equanimity free from passion aggression and prejudice A Buddhist prayer to cultivate the four immeasurables Lovingkindness Compassion Empathy and Equanimity Introduction Elevating Darkness I didnt set out to write a book about growing up But as those whove attempted to get their thoughts down on paper know the true nature of the book revealed itself after Id begun the excavations behind a simple question What do I believe to be true about work leadership and how we may live our lives The simplicity of the answer startled me I believe that better humans make better leaders I further believe that the process of learning to lead well can help us become better humans By growing to meet the demands of the call to leadership were presented with the chance to finally fully grow up Such revealed wisdom is often better than discovered wisdom Its best I suspect because it comes from our lived experiences and the intrinsic and inherent depths of our being Moreover such a revelation is better because it transforms us it is a process that can come about only from learning to be still learning to listen Standing still and powering down allow us to start anew and if you will reboot our core operating and belief systems Standing still and listening deeply to our heart as well as to the hearts around us are the necessary first steps toward moving past merely numbly surviving our lives As poet Terry Tempest Williams advises we learn then to speak and comprehend words of wounding without having these words become the landscape where we dwell With such comprehending we elevate the darkness of our lives lead from the realm of the stars and continue growing up I had a sense that this was true at the very first planning meeting for the book Hollis Heimbouch my editor friend and teacher and Jim Levine my agent friend and teacher and I sat at a conference table in Jims office to plot out the book Earlier Jim had shown me around his office including a small room filled with Muppetlike puppets Glancing quickly at the collection one caught my attention Is that you I asked Jim He laughed and said somewhat shyly and with pride Yeah Thats me Back at the table we sat together My heart raced I squirmed uncomfortably while sweating We talked about the books on leadership that we admired We spoke of writers whod moved each of us Jim spoke of the things Id written the questions Id asked people to consider I love your simple powerful questions like What is work he said I was pleased but still nervous My eyes darted between the two of them Hollis had a hand on a large stack of papers my work old blog posts and an interview or two I love the way you provoke people You get them to think differently As I looked from one to the other and back again an insight struck me Wait You dont want me to write a book of advice about the five things every entrepreneur should know about leadership Thenand this will surprise no one who really knows meI burst into tears Oh no said a surprised Hollis while looking to Jim Not at all We want you to do your book They wanted me to write the book I was supposed to writemy book My initial relief was quickly replaced by terror I understood immediately that the excavations necessary to make sense of these intertwined and interdependent truthsthat leadership requires an authentic and vulnerable dive into the wrecks of our liveswould force me to grow in ways I hadnt bargained for After I started writing and began experiencing all sorts of uncomfortable memories and revelations a dear friend warned Writing this book is gonna kick your butt So it went and so it still goes The personal challenge didnt stem from coming to grips with writing well about the how of leadership The challenge stemmed from the demand Id placed on myself to show up fully bravely and to look inward without looking away While it is true that to lead with depth resolve congruency and resilience you must have the faith to look inward it is equally true that to speak of such things without being willing to reveal your own actualization your own journey to adulthood would be hollow and empty Hollow and empty would not suffice Turning the pursuit of purpose mission and leadership into the means to discover the adult lurking within us requires that we show up with radical authenticity That we includes me To live up to the belief that the pursuit of leadership requires a pursuit of growing up we must be willing to work with that which arises in the pursuit This includes that which arises whether we take our seat as a CEO an author or simply as ourselves as we were born I wouldnt ask you to do something that I am not willing to attempt myself Perhaps my touch hasnt been as light deft and skillful as I would have liked Perhaps in my rush to share and grow theres a weightiness to my words that I didnt consciously intend or wouldnt have chosen Perhaps youd prefer that I told you how to do the job rather than ask you why youd like to do the job in the first place Perhaps then I frustrate you If so forgive me Sometimes as my daughter Emma once observed I ask the questions youd rather not answer Sometimes though my wish to elevate the darkness to the realm of the stars gets the better of me The Formula As often happens I hit upon the insight I needed when I wasnt searching for it A few years back I was pacing the room thinking about the talk I was about to give There were thirty people in stiff uncomfortable chairs As usual my Tshirt was mildly sweaty As usual I was shoelessdiscalced I was struggling to explain coaching struggling to explain why it was that to help people lead well I was pushing to help them know themselves better They were leaders each of them Some came from established organizations and were in the middle of their careers Some were new to the demands of organizational leadership All of them were struggling All of them were there in effect for coaching With enthusiastic excitement and a touch of frustration I grabbed some dryerase markers and pulled a whiteboard to the front of the room Its like this I shared as I began sketching in my indecipherable scrawl everyone is always looking for the how to do things And I wrote Practical Skills But really they need to understand the why of what they do and ultimately who they are I continued racing across the board scrawling out Radical Selfinquiry And when they do that when they look in places theyve avoided they often get stuck I continued They get scared They get lost in their fears and in old patterns of selfloathing So mired in their selfcriticism they think theyre the only one who hasnt a fucking clue as to what they are doing or how to live Worse I continued theyre too damned afraid to admit that theyre making shit up And they stay stuck in these lonely leadership bubbles spinning Scared Lonely Afraid of being found out My words hung in the air I could feel their bodies tensing with fear I knew they were holding their breath But then someone is brave enough to go first Some brave soul admits that she feels in trouble And the tribe around her lets out their breath The folks in the room firsttime CEOs each of them let out a collective breath I wrote Sharing the experience with friends and peers on the whiteboard and as I wrote I said and suddenly people realize theyre not alone And even more that if were all feeling this way then maybe just maybe the feelings may be true but the facts may be inaccurate I turned back to the audience pausing to let my words sink in You are not alone A few folks begin to tear up I turned to the board and sketched in plus signs between the statements drew an equals sign underneath as if I were creating a fraction a mathematical formula Under the line I wrote Enhanced leadership plus greater resiliency I then drew thick red lines under the word resiliency While I care about you being better leaders I said I care more about you being able to survive I want you to not make yourselves sick I want you to be happy to see your families even to have families to lay your head down on the pillow at night and rest in the belief that you are okay that the world is okay that all whom you love and care about are okay and that even if things dont go as planned youll still be okay I want you to not end up wondering if the world would be better off without you I want you to have peace of mind Resiliency I stressed is an antecedent to equanimity Practical skills I explained are the things that everyone believes necessary to succeed as leaders They are the skills that describe the how of the jobthe incredibly important necessary skills needed to grow and build organizations How do you hire someone How do you fire someone How do you scale a team How do you raise the capital to launch a business Discussing and encouraging people to share what they are going through often takes a little practice Ive got a wellearned reputation for making people cry and in a sense I helped found an executive coaching company Reboot to help folks do just that to share whats really going on Whether its in individual sessions with a coach or at one of our boot camps multiday immersive experiences that folks have come to call RebootsI and my colleagues explain that the secret to getting people to cry is simply to ask them to feel Or more specifically ask them to slow down enough to notice how they are feeling My radical surprising unprecedented question that always does the trick is quite simple I ask How are you But then I follow it up with No Really how are you Not I emphasize the bullshit throwaway line we toss at each other without thinking the Im fine How are you that passes for empathetic inquiry and honest conversation I ask a genuinely curious How are you in a way that allows people to honestly inquire within and equally important share the response with others who have allowed themselves to be equally open Start with a genuine How are you I tell folks and then move on to describing the thingspractical and existentialthat are troubling you Share with folks and equally important stay open and listen to their answers as well Then simply notice how the isolation and overwhelm shift even a tiny bit But the most challenging piece of the formulaindeed the most importantis the notion of radically inquiring within I define it as the process by which selfdeception becomes so skillfully and compassionately exposed that no mask can hide us anymore The notion is to recognize that if things are not okay if youre struggling you stop pretending and allow yourself to get help Even more its the process by which you work hard to know yourselfyour strengths your struggles your true intentions your true motivations the characteristics of the character known as you The you behind the masks the stories the protective but no longer useful belief systems that have been presented for so long as the you that you would like everyone to see Invariably such inquiry involves getting to know as the poet Adrienne Rich says not the story of the wreck but the wreck itself With help patience courage and guidance we explore the wreck and retrieve the treasure Knowing how to survive and understanding what it takes to thrive are skills that come from our childhood Take any random group of entrepreneurs for example and do a quick unscientific survey by asking them to raise their hands if they grew up in an environment where at least one parent had disappeared or left or was never present Most hands will shoot up Early promotion into adulthood is often painful and equally often a sign of an early promotion into leadership Probe a bit further and you may find that leaders who have built their company may have unconsciously stacked the team with other folks who experienced such early promotion Radically inquiring within allows us to step back and see the patterns of our lives not as random acts of a willful or even vengeful god but as forces that shape who we are Its this understanding that will make us not only better leaders but better happier more resilient people Not Practical but Useful In writing this book my goal is to provide an experience that allows you to do your work I want you to experience being challenged to grow to think about the structures of your life Reading the book should feel like a coaching session or a boot camp a time to step away from habitual and longheld patterns using tools of inquiry that tap into your unconscious mind unmask you and that can enhance your sense of community which is essential to healing A wellasked question creates a sense of wellbeing even as it disrupts the story making that has protected us for so long As you read this book Id like you to hold these questions in your heart 1 How did my relationship to money first get formed and how does it influence the way I work as an adult What was the belief system around money and work that I grew up with Chapter 1 2 How can I lead with the dignity courage and grace that are my birthright How can I use even the loss of status and the challenge to my selfesteem that are inherent in leadership to grow into the adult I want to be in the world Chapter 2 3 In what ways have I depleted myself run myself into the ground Where am I running from and where to Why have I allowed myself to be so exhausted Chapter 3 4 Who is the person Ive been all my life What can that person teach me about becoming the leader I want to be What was the story my family told about being real being vulnerable being true Chapter 4 5 Why do I struggle so much with the folks in my life Why are relationships so difficult What am I not saying to my cofounder my colleagues my family members my life partner that needs to be said Chapter 5 6 Whats my purpose Why does it feel Im lost while I struggle to move forward How do I grow transform and find meaning Chapter 6 7 How has who I am shaped the ways I lead others and myself What are the unconscious patterns of my character structure that are showing up in my organizations Chapter 7 8 How might I survive my life of heartbreak How might I live in peace Chapter 8 9 What kind of leader and adult am I What is enough How will I know when my job is done Chapter 9 As you read on consider the lessons you have internalized about the risks and possibilities of being open vulnerable and real What were you taught about being yourself What has been the benefit of following that teaching What was the cost Work gives us the means to create the physical safety upon which our lives depend Work feeds and shelters us and those we love Work can give us meaning But work can also be a means of our suffering By understanding whats truly happening all around us the ways our core belief systems influence our everyday experience we can extract meaning from the suffering coax the lotus from the mud as the Buddhists teach But this will happen only if we use those challenges that the calls to leadership make on us not only to grow up but also help us discover our why There are worthy helpful and pragmatic books that can help you focus on the how In the end I suppose Ive always found more helpful resources that have helped me unpack the whys of our lives Helping people sort through the why of life helps them access all they need to know to answer the hows that work demands The hows of life and leadership are endless If you enhance your understanding of the why of who you are youll be able to face the unending uncertainty in the pursuit of the perfectly executed how Moreover if such inquiry is done well with wellasked questions and deeply true answers you will end up with a tailormade how Such work may not feel quite so practical at first but it is undeniably useful This is the goal of this book To be useful in understanding the why of your leadership This is what I try to do with the leaders with whom I work every day This is my wish for you The Seedbed for Growth In the space between our memories and the stories we create about ourselves we live our lives We create our companies We create our wishes and dreams and gather in those around us as our families and our communities Exploring that space between memories and the stories we create allows us to emerge as the leaders we were born to be My journey as a leader has taught me that my childhood demanded a hypervigilance and that to stay safe I learned to work ceaselessly to try to make sense of the world even as I was confronted with insensible acts and facts As part of that effort I listened closelycollecting and holding the stories of those around me as clues to a puzzling life The result is that I often see hear sense things that others miss This can be a source of great wisdom But this sensing can be an impediment to my peace of mind as well for I can create whole ships of fiction out of the random flotsam and jetsam that float my way Still when I sit well and quietly I can see a way through the puzzle especially when another is blocked I laugh as I recall that one of my favorite childhood pastimes was completing books of mazes I like working my way out of mazes I am good at it Among the many things I have seen and experienced is the wisdom of elders those who have come before me elders such as my longtime psychoanalyst Dr Avivah Sayres my Buddhist teacher Sharon Salzberg and my dear friend and soul brother Parker Palmer Watching my elders age I have come to understand the wisdom of not only growing up but aging gracefully and for one entering deaththe thing I fear most of all with courage and humor I suspect such elderwisdom stems from inquiring into the nature of suffering and your formation It manifests in a more complete understanding of your life and when your work is done Enough as Parker writes in a beautiful poem called Harrowing The Job is done Such elderwisdom seeps into and strengthens my bones Theres a wisdom in being able to discern when the job is done For the job to be done we must know that its time to let go of the striving to become and allow ourselves the restful grace of simply being In my effort to simply be Ive learned to balance the disquietude of the past with the lifegiving excitement of the future the seedbed for the growing to come Harrowing by Parker J Palmer The plow has savaged this sweet field Misshapen clods of earth kicked up Rocks and twisted roots exposed to view Last years growth demolished by the blade I have plowed my life this way Turned over a whole history Looking for the roots of what went wrong Until my face is ravaged furrowed scarred Enough The job is done Whatevers been uprooted let it be Seedbed for the growing thats to come I plowed to unearth last years reasons The farmer plows to plant a greening season Chapter 1 Passing GO Mom was my Monopoly buddy When I was a boy Mom and I spent hours playing Monopoly To this day I love rainy days in part because back then when it rained wed spend the day playing board games from Chutes and Ladders to The Game of Life But I loved Monopoly most of all I loved that it could take hours to play properly not the shortened version where you dealt out the cards representing properties but the right way the way according to the rules where you collected properties only after landing on them and buying or trading them I loved collecting those deeds I loved being the thimble the iron the dog I loved passing Go and collecting 200 I felt great about amassing money but most of all I loved surprising people with what I was capable of doing When I was a boy I wasnt often seen I was looked after cared for I was held and comforted especially after some painful experience But I wasnt often seen I was a good boy when inside I wanted to rage I tried hard all the time when inside I wanted not to care I was compliant and therefore complicit in not being fully appreciated When I was a boy and we played Monopoly everyone would lay out money in front Piles of currency neatly stacked and sorted 500s 100s 50s and so on Not me though Id keep all my money stacked together under the game board I didnt need to lay it out in front of me to know my worth Id keep track in my head of how much I had And Id surprise everyone by buying up their properties when they were bankrupt Id surprise them with my cleverness and cunning When my cunning my skills my ability to understand and work with money would be revealed Id feel seen not for being goodquiet compliant a good boybut for being mea good person who was also smart and skillful Whats more at seven I came to understand that while people might not see you might not get you you could use that fact to survive The Game of Life Hi Ho CherryO and Monopoly taught me about life I learned for example that you needed money to win to be safe to never be hungry With it you could buy real estate you could put little green houses on those properties and then over time generate more money If you played the game right you could generate enough to make sure that Mom and Dad didnt fight about having enough food Dad wouldnt yell at Mom if you took more than two Oreos There were nine of us in the twobedroom apartment on the ground floor of a small Brooklyn building owned by my grandfather I was born in December 1963 a month after JFK was killed By then my oldest siblings Vito and Mary were already beginning to cycle in and out of the house While the same small space was home for all of us it was rare that wed all be there at the same time Dad was a foreman at a printing company a place at which he had worked since high school and to which he came back after serving in the army Mom stayed home with us Dad was a good man whose broken heart sometimes led him to drink to drunkenness Mom was a good woman whose broken childhood led to mental illness that further led her to hear and see things that as often as not werent there Together they had more kids than they could afford financially as well as emotionally Being number six of seven I grew up wondering whether it was I who had tipped the scales broken the camels back I worried I was the mouth that was one too many to feed the one who caused the whole lot of us to never have enough to feel safe warm and happy My mothers father Dominic Guido was an iceman He sold ice in the summer coal in the winter and homemade wine all year long Mom always said his shoulders were covered with hair to protect his body from the fifty pound blocks of ice he carried up the stoops of houses in Brooklyn Hed dropped out of school in the sixth grade in his home village in Italy Palo del Colle just outside Bari Hed made his way to the States and become an entrepreneursomeone no venture capitalist would ever fund even though he understood the most important principle of business end the day with more money than you began it Grandpa always seemed to have enough and even a little extra to spare for us He owned the building where my family lived the same building where my mother and then later my sisters would mop the hallways Grandpa would visit on Saturdays usually bringing food My father would stiffen as Grandpa came down the hallway and into our apartment filling the room with the smell of woolen underwear and Old Spice Grandpa and Dad had a hard relationship There were a few possible reasons From Grandpas perspective I could see how he might have blamed Dad for their having had all of us Mom was pregnant with my brother Vito after all when they got married She had too many kids I imagine him thinking thats why she was sick And of course to their Catholic eyes it was a sin that Mom was pregnant before marriage She sinned thats why she got sick Devoutly religious Mom must have been racked by guilt I can hear her assuaging her guilt now I would have had a dozen shed say all the time speaking of us kids if only the doctors would have let me Maybe from Grandpas point of view it was Dads beers She would yell all the time about his drinking which worsened after his time in the army right after they were married In manic moments Mom would slam the table and focus on Dads two sixpacks of Pabst Blue Ribbon a night When she was kind shed guess that the stench of the Nazi death camps hed visited in postwar Germany caused him to drink When she was unkind she poked at the fact that he wasnt really Italian that hed been adopted by an Italian family and he was really a drunk German or Irishman If only he werent a drunk I can hear Grandpa saying to himself then my daughter wouldnt be sick But maybe the tension between Grandpa and Dad was rooted in the family splits that went all the way back to the pale limestone of Palo del Colle outside of Bari In that tiny village both Dads mother Mary Colonna and Moms mother Nicoletta Guido were cousins But not just cousins they were rivals As a girl Mary was orphaned and raised by her aunt Nicoletta and Mary were in a sense sisters To heighten the tensions each of them married an iceman Mary married Vito who was never the entrepreneur that Dominic was If I were forced to guess I think Grandpa blamed Dad for Moms illness Her delusions her mania her depression started around the time they got married If only shed married someone else had had a different life was able to go to art school as shed hoped I imagine him saying then maybe my baby girl wouldnt be sick As a father now my heart aches when I think of him worrying about his baby girl my mother I weep when I think of Grandpa helpless and angry watching his baby his seventh of seven children being strapped into a straitjacket and carted away to a hospital to have her memories and suffering mind jolted with electroshock therapy again and again And again Its hard even to imagine his feelings as his daughters seven children were divvied up among her siblings and how he and my grandmother would take in my brother John and me Even when Mom wasnt in the hospital John and I would visit Grandpa and Grandma on Wednesdays after school Their house smelled wonderful of lemon drops kept in a tin in the hallway cupboard with the pale green door of coffee ground with a handcranked grinder that hung on a kitchen wall beneath a photo of the saint Padre Pio and in summer of newly cut roses from Grandmas garden and figs picked from the tree growing next to the porch at the back of their kitchena tree brought as a sapling from Palo del Colle and protected from winter by being wrapped in blankets and old rugs with a bucket on top to keep the rain and snow out Such smells still drop me to my knees I pass a tree whose springtime blossoms are just bursting out and am teleported instantly to Brooklyns Prospect Park on a cool April morning The oddly tangy metallic smell of Coppertone sunscreen still makes me feel as if Ive got grains of beach sand stuck in my teeth remnants of the bologna sandwiches Mom would make for our trips to Coney Island Smells bypass the cognitive adult parts of my brain and go directly to my soul The smells of coffee roses and lemon drops signal Im safe I grind whole beans and once again Im five years old snuggled into Grandmas lap my head on her bosom rocking in her arms safe warm and happy Grandma and Grandpas house was my sanctuary from the chaos of home To my childs heart money meant roses fresh figs ground coffee and lemon drops forever Money was safety The pursuit of money then became a chase for safety and a flight from poverty chaos and the streets of my childhood What will it take Dr Sayres my psychoanalyst asks me nearly forty years later When will you stop I was in my thirtiesa father a successand I would lie on her couch staring at the ceiling Id been staring at that damn ceiling for seven or eight years already Bill Gates I sputter shocked at my own response I never thought of myself as pursuing Gateslike wealth I liked to think I was above that But as I lay there I had to admit that to the little boy whod spent Sunday dinners hiding out under the dining room table becoming Bill Gatesrich would mean lemon drops forever Money of course brought with it admiration People thought I was smart because I had money Some of these same folks had dismissed me when it seemed that all Id amount to would be poet or college professorwise but poor Money success in business had given me access to power Suddenly it seemed my opinion mattered to businesspeople to politicians to leaders of all sorts To the people who as a boy I barely knew existed when I played scully shooting bottlecaps filled with crayon wax on boards carved into the asphalt of East 26th Street in Flatbush Brooklyn Money and success meant admiration acknowledgment accolades Money and success came to seem ends unto themselves I wasnt completely delusional of course And I wasnt entirely enraptured by money There was always enough of the poet inside me to remind me of the falsity of those goals As with Monopoly the pursuit of success in business became a game something to pursue for gratification of the intellect See Id quietly whisper to myself Im not just a schmuck from Flatbush I can run with the big dogs Success and moneyand even more important the busyness needed to create thosebecame proof of my worth as a human Bill Gates Lemon Drops and Me It surprised me that becoming rich would lead me to want to kill myself But there I was standing on the lip of the smoking stinking hole of Ground Zero After the 911 attack I had agreed to two things the first to join JPMorgan as a venture capital investor and the second to serve as a coexecutive director for New York Citys Olympic Bid committee The former was a plot to scoop up lemon drops The latter was intended to somehow help New York my home my city recover and for me to be seen as the hero I yearned to be In the weeks following the attacks Id lain awake at night anxious I managed the anxiety by trawling through survival websites looking for emergency ration kits and creating go bags of food water medical supplieseverything my family and I would need if New York were to be attacked again In this hurting state of mind I began working at JPMorgan and dived deep into raising money for the Olympic bid effort I was good at both jobs Moving to JPMorgan from my former venture capital firm Flatiron Partners where I had already amassed a track record as a smart investor and managed to be beloved at the same time I immediately made some good deals that within a year or two returned three to five times the capital wed invested The fundraising went well I made appearances throughout the city drumming up support for the Olympic bid I remember showing up at a community center in Flushing Queens raising money from a local chapter of the IBEW the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers They didnt just attack our country Id say imitating a preacher as I walked the room they attacked our home A city where one hundred eighteen languages are spoken among our 12 million schoolkids They attacked your family They attacked my family They attacked us But on this day I teetered on the edge of Ground Zero among the piles that were just months before the twin towers of the World Trade Center The ping ping ping of heavy equipment whose gears had been thrown in reverse rang out bulldozers moved piles of shattered glass shrapnel and the smashed remains of people who months before were just trying to make enough money to buy their kids lemon drops Wall Streeters pass a frozen me as though I were just another of the thousands of ghosts haunting the streets of lower Manhattan Panic fills my lungs choking out the air I wear a suit and tie to signify my power I am rich I have a beautiful family Im well respected I even have a new sense of purposeLook at me Look at how helpful to my City I am I am a good boy I have all the lemon drops I could ever want And still the old seenbutnotseen feelings remain I still cant shake the sense that I am hollow not really occupying the meat bag that is me Im in my life but not really living So why bother I ask myself I want to die My head swirls I want to run downstairs to the subway platform and hide Instead I reach for my cell phone and call Dr Sayres in Great Neck Get in a cab and come see me she says taking control Get here now Over the coming weeks wed talk about what was happening to me Being there but not really being there Living a life of therebutnotthere hurt like hell And wed talk about money success Bill Gates and lemon drops The attacks on 911 hurt me Like so many people I was scared The night before the attacks Id gone to Yankee Stadium to see my Yanks take on the damn Red Sox Roger Clemens was going for his twentieth win that season and I had great seats The game was rained out Nevertheless I stayed in Manhattan that night away from my home on Long Island The next morning September 11 I had an earlymorning flight to Washington I was having breakfast with some senators when the news of the attacks came in As with many that day remains with me A blurry haze of feelings and memories desperation to get home to my family in New York Desperate to find out if those I loved were safe warm and happy But thats not what really drove me to the edge that day in 2002 a few months after the attack It was the hollowness of my life itself It was the realization that despite having more lemon drops than I could have imagined my heart still hurt It would take many more years to talk through all that had formed me to sort through the bags Id been carrying since childhood These were my particular habits of mind the experiences patterns and beliefs that had led me to seek safety and solace through a reallife game of Monopoly by amassing as much money as I could by grabbing lemon drops and by constantly comparing my success to that of Bill Gates This was my mess my messy baggage and now at forty I was going to have to start taking inventory I was going to have to start sorting it out There was no place to hide When I was in high school I studied photography and filmmaking I remain fascinated by the fact that film is deceptive What appears to be fluid ongoing and always in motion is in fact a series of still moments viewed incredibly quickly Just like life itself What appears fluid is twentyfour frames per second Twentyfour precious moments per second lived second after second after second And each of those still moments is imbued with feelings and memories The rapid fluidity of each of those moments defines the patterns and beliefs that in turn define our lives Our lives are twentyfour frames per second with each frame a set piece of feeling belief obsession about the past and anxiety about the future Neither good nor bad these frames form us They become the stories we tell ourselves again and again to make sense of who were becoming who weve been and who we want to be Ghosts of our pastsour grandparents and their grandparents as well as the ghosts of their livesinhabit the frames They and their beliefs interpretations of scenes words and feelings haunt the frames of lives as surely as the roses figs and lemon drops of our present daily lives do Slowing down the movie of our lives seeing the frames and how they are constructed reveals a different way to live a way to break old patterns to see experiences anew through radical selfinquiry PoleClimbing Monkeys Late into a first conversation with a coaching client I listen deeply for ghosts in the frames of his life Jerry Im sixtyfour and I need to figure out what Ill be doing with my life after I retire Hes wealthy enough Hes certainly successful enough And hes an incredibly wellregarded public figure Tell me about your decision to take that job in Baltimore fifteen years ago I ask following my intuition Its funny that you ask about that says my client a little shocked My father told me it was the worst decision of my life that I was going to regret that decision forever He said If you do this youll be raising the white flag on your career Suddenly Im thrust back to being twentytwo Ive been working at the magazine for two years since my collegeage summer internship began Im being recruited to be a speechwriter and an aide to the CEO of NCR in Dayton Ohio I turn to my Dad for advice Remember Jerry the higher up the pole the monkey climbs the more his ass shows His fear my fathers fear is clear Stay low Stay outta sight Stay safe I dont know what you should do when you retire I say returning to my client But Ill be happy to be your thought partner as you work it through That said I continue I suspect that its time to no longer make decisions based on your fathers fear To no longer avoid his disapproval or to seek his approval That feels like a good place to start this inquiry Or we can keep trying to put them aside to ignore them to shove the baggage of our lives into storage unsorted heavy taking up more room with each year Tracing forward from these remembrances of things past gives us the chance to reexperience and reframe these beliefs Doing so liberates us from the confounding forces we label as fate destiny oreven more frequentlythe other persons fault We will never sort through them all of course but what we dont sort through impedes our happiness It tricks us into using the rest of our livesand the people we love the professions we choose the organizations we leadto try to close the gaping wounds from childhood The Safety of Trees On a hot summer morning I stand in the shade of the dying horse chestnut tree its fivefingered leaves each with a sawtooth edge shade and cool the air I am seven When it rains hard the fattest nuts fall from the branches their spikes thick hard and sharp their green skin veined with brown spots and worms The warm rain slips from leaf to leaf as I sit beneath the hundredfoottall tree In its trunk is a crack just big enough for me to hide in I love the rain I love being in but not quite all the way in the rain The tree is my favorite hiding spot The trees flowers are white and pink and the leaf clusters that look so much like hands have unfolded as if in prayer Wetnot wet Warmnot warm In but out Seen but not seen Safe but scared Inside the building behind the bay windows of our groundfloor apartment Mom and Dad are arguing again Shes accusing him again of having an affair Again he sits there silently Again I wait for it his explosive response She speaks so loudly that our entire inner life spills out onto East 26th Street The bay windows cant contain their pain Pablo who smeared dog shit on my face just the week before walks by and jeers at me Even today I see his leering face with his gash of a mouth and tongue stuck out Five years older than me and maybe a foot taller Pablo always scared me He seemed to love to torture us younger kids He loved to taunt me to get me so angry that my face would swell and redden and Id stand in the middle of the asphalt screaming in fury One day he stuck a branch from the chestnut tree into a steaming pile of shit and chased me around and around a red car my head spinning in fear the air scraping my throat as I desperately tried to outrun Pablo and the stick Such were the games little boys played on East 26th Street Over time the crack in the trees trunk would grow and the city would cut it down Halfdead it had become misshapen and distorted unsafe to passersby But right then as a child I wanted nothing more than to disappear into that crack to escape the sounds coming from our house to escape the taunts and humiliations of childhood to shove it all aside The boy under the tree hiding to feel safe wishing for lemon drops wishing to be found Found but not found out Because if I were found out they might not like what they saw For being myself was never good enough Being myself wouldnt stop Mom and Dad from fighting It wouldnt guarantee we would have enough money It wouldnt stop Dad from going out to Johns Grocery Store for two sixpacks of Pabst Blue Ribbon every night It wouldnt stop Mom from talking to Jesus or to the late Bobby Kennedy And it failed to keep her from saying she was going to kill herself again and again and again And if being myself wasnt good enough to keep me lemondrop safe how could I ever have been comfortable in my skin as a leader How could I take my seat as an adult How could I grow up Choosing to Become Me Money Safety Shame A sense of belonging A desire for escape The fear of being found out The fear of not being seen of not being known and accepted for who I am A desire to please These paradoxes these secrets continue to shape us But who we choose to be is awakened by the truths we choose to tell There are no epiphanies no immediate radical discoveries that will suddenly and without work unwind the twisted balls of yarn that define our lives But there are knowable moments and seeing those knowable moments and the ghosts they give rise to can help uschildren no more become the adults we want to be This is radical selfinquiry This is the practice of making something good out of the accumulation of losses and false narratives that we all experience I am not what has happened to me taught Carl Jung I am what I choose to become But choosing requires knowing It requires knowing how what happened to us influences the choices we made and continue to make Again and again I ask my clients How are you complicit in creating the conditions of your lives that you say you dont want But even more in what ways does that complicity serve you How does it serve my soontobe retired client to remain disconnected from himself such that he doesnt know how hed like to spend his days In what ways does it serve him to continue the battle for his fathers approval and against his fathers disapproval Weve gathered as we often do on the first night of one of my companys boot camps We gather folks to help them learn to lead by coming to know themselves better The knowingthemselvesbetter can be so painful that we liken the process to boot camp a rigorous training ground We sit safely in a circle I read a poem Tears are flowing in the small circle as they come to what will be the first of many recognitions They are not alone They are not alone in their fear in their shame in feeling unmoored and lost We are here for radical selfinquiry I tell them because that is the path of authenticity and that path leads to resiliency What the fuck are we doing listening to a poem one camper yells his faced twisting in anger I didnt come here to listen to goddamn poetry I came here to be a better CEO I have a greedy sonofabitch head of sales and hes driving everyone crazy and I dont know what to do about him Thats why Im here Ive seen this resistance before I stay steady Ill make a deal with you I say If you stay through the weekend and if at the end of the weekend you dont know what to do with him Ill give you your money back He calms down Two days later were deep into it Ive asked everyone to look at their own lives to look at the companies theyve created the conditions they say they dont want I turn to the camper with the greedy head of sales I shock him Tell me about the shame He looks up his eyes marked by the pain of a hard hard life I was a teenager when I ran away he says tears streaming I started drinking then I ended up living under an overpass Tell me about the night and the promise you made to yourself I prompt Hes startled His eyes ask How did you know He says out loud It was raining and I was cold He goes on to explain that hed sworn that he was never going to be cold or hungry or alone again I nod in recognition I see him as he sees himself more fully Who hired the sales guy He looks around sheepishly I did And who promoted him Me says the camper There is nothing to be ashamed of I tell him The problem isnt his greed Hes just doing what you hired him to do You outsourced your need to never be cold and hungry again to someone more acceptable And hes doing a great job at that What if you took back your greed I ask him and instead see it for what it truly is a desire to be safe warm and happy Take back the wish take back the promise you made to yourself leave aside the shame and own the fear not as something to deny but as something that fuels you He brightens I continue Lets expand that view now Lets go beyond making sure that you and your family are never hungry again Lets see the ways you and your company have made it possible for your employees and their families to not be hungry To feel safe warm and happy His body unfolds and we all bear witness to his taking his seat not merely as a CEO but as a man capable of providing for the boy under the overpass Radical selfinquiry is how we learn to become more of ourselves more like ourselves more authentic More human And better humans are better leaders This is what great leaders do Great leaders look unflinchingly in the mirror and transform untamed hungers and unruly compulsions into moments of selfcompassion and understanding In doing so they create the spaces for each of us to do the same turning our organizations into places of growth and selfactualization They infuse the profanity of work with the sacred duty of Work the opportunities to lead to grow into their whole selves while nurturing others encouraging them to do the same It would be easy to paint my realization around work as sacred duty as something sprung from some genius within It was not It sprang from exhaustion from being lost myself from having nowhere else to turn with my own suffering Theres a story of the Buddha coming to realize the Four Noble Truths the four foundational beliefs of Buddhism In the story he comes to these profound realizations after years of wondering and wandering seeking answers In my mind though the Buddha is from Flatbush Brooklyn When he finally comes to this moment its with utter desperation and more than a little anger Fuck it I hear him say to himself I cant figure out shit And Im just gonna sit under this bodhi tree until either I die or it makes sense And so he sits So I sat Id walked away from a job a title status and the pursuit of passing Go and collecting my next 200 I sat until I began to glimpse the ways I had been complicit in creating the conditions I said I didnt want I sat until I began to realize that acknowledging these things within myself was the first step to really being seento having the thing Id wished for all my life My noble truth Im humbled to admit didnt come from within me It came from the simple act of choosing to continue to live Between the thing that triggers us and our unconsciously chosen action is a tiny bit of space We grow in such spaces We radically inquire within in those spaces Sitting still we get to see the spaces between the frames of lives speeding by and as a result see the whole movie with an unattached eye In sitting under my bodhi tree I quietly came to find my truest calling My friend the poet Pdraig Tuama says To live well is to see wisely and to see wisely is to tell stories Ill go further telling stories helps us live well Telling the stories of our lives telling the stories of the lives around us helps us make sense of the world and in the end be wise Wise and sacred Years ago as I was beginning to distance myself more fully from that day in 2002 when I teetered on the edge of my own Ground Zero I was alone naked in a desert in southern Utah On the second day of a threenight wateronly fast as part of a fourteenday quest I settled into the meaning of the true name Id be given Holder Holder of Stories of the Heart Holder of my stories Holder of the stories of those I love Holder of the stories of the brokenhearted leaders who come to me On that second day I woke with terrible pains in my stomach Id had plenty of water but the lack of food was breaking me down The day before Id stripped down to as few clothes as I could bear It was a relief to have as little as possible between me the true me and the Earth itself But the bare skin left me raw The lack of food left me weak tired and emotionally spent I looked up to a cluster of boulders and saw a face Grandfather Boulder I named him I asked him about my life Holder he taught me listening opens that which pain has closed You were not given this life only to lament he went on Make holy that which you were given Go and listen Listening Ive come to understand is bearing witness to lives unfolding to lives being discovered Deep listening listening compassionately means guiding gently nudging or sometimes shoving people down the path of radical selfinquiry so they can make their way to their own truest selves Then and only then can they lead with the dignity and grace of being human The goal then is to help you listen to the stories of your heart so that in the end you can know the why of your leadership journey and become the adult the full human you were meant to be Then the simple but hard task becomes clear Lead from the place of your truest self Do so not merely for yourself but for those who love and entrust their careers to you The process of radical selfinquiry into ones own leadership journey is supported by standing still and taking the time to ask oneself open honest questions around the rules we carry Following each chapter will be a series of questions to prompt your own inquiry Consider these as invitations to inquire within Journaling Invitations How did my relationship to money first get formed How did that relationship shape the work Ive chosen and my definitions of success and failure How does it shape my view of the quality of others work and contributions What was the belief system around money and work that I grew up with How does that impact my view of my own worthiness Chapter 2 The Crucible and the Warrior Of course the night would be perfect the stars crisp and achingly bright the lulling cadence of cars crossing into Brooklyn from Manhattan over Colonel Roeblings wondrous bridge the kathump kathump kathump of tires hitting expansion joints Even here on the roof deck of an old Jehovahs Witnesses building some eight floors above the streets of Dumbo the air is tinged with a faint mix of lilac honeysuckle and diesel exhaust Im sitting on a picnic table while Chad Dickerson sips from a bottle of beer Of course of course of course the night would be sweet and bitter Tomorrow Chad will announce to the world that hes been asked to step down as CEO of Etsy the online marketplace for handcrafted goods he had led for the past six years I am here to listen to bear witness to and hold the story of this bittersweet moment Its painful to watch my client my friend confront this new reality Although hed done many things right although hed grown into a leader with heart and authenticity he was being fired His pain hangs in the air And because my vocation is to be with people in their joy and their suffering to hold myself as a container for them to work through such moments my pain is exquisitebeautiful delicate sharp piercing my heart like a needle Nevertheless theres no place Id rather be than here with him with this pain Listening I remember opens that which pain has closed I watch his eyesI always watch my clients eyes Our eyes moist with memories we talk of the time six years before Just a few weeks into the job hed called me on his walk home from the office The sudden reality of being CEO had churned the bile of his selfdoubt and hed vomited Oh Jerry he said then Help me I cant do this Yes you can Id told him then Oh Jerry he says to me now turning his weary beatendown eyes to me I did a good job didnt I Yeah Yeah you did I assure him We met regularly for most of those six years Usually in his office surrounded by handmade Etsy thingsa cutting board in the shape of New York State handpolished cherry guitar picks and coasters made to look like handmade cherry guitar picks Outside the office monstrous AC ducts had been wrapped in knitted covers to mask the ugly metal Sometimes we met in a conference room even more beautifully decorated I wont forget the quilted and stuffed faux deer head mounted on the wall as if after a kill Wed talk of practical challenges The difficulty of building an executive team when the company had such a profound history of dysfunction and a culture where all things that smacked of traditional business were rightfully suspect How do you attract a CFO a general counsel or a head of marketing when the culture finds such functions an anathema How do you hold the heart of what is special embracing the rebels and misfits who define the greatness of your organization while creating a tolerant and caring space for those whove built their career on doing well at more traditional companies Back on the roof Im startled I see something familiar but new in Chad something powerful something even more important than success or failure as a CEO Years before Id given him the metaphor I often use with clients Take your seat Sit like royalty in your leadership seat I say Sit as if youve the right to be there Over time hed done just that Hed taken his seat the company had grown hed built a powerful team and the stomach churning had subsided He did this by looking at his own stuff through radical selfinquiry Welcome to the NotKnowing Clients come to me seeking the answers How the hell do I do this job they ask either implicitly or explicitly They act as if theres a playbook a secret handbook that will teach them everything they need to know about leading The worst are the high achievers the folks who made it through school by quickly figuring out what it took to get an A and then delivering whatever the teacher wanted Figure out the rules theyd learned and succeed And when theyre given the task of leading and they cant figure out the rules the vomitinducing panic takes over This situation is nailed by a wonderful scene near the end of the seven year run of the TV show Mad Men Peggy whos finally fully in charge turns to her old boss Don for help Don whos about to leave the world of mad men forever has emerged as a brokenhearted sage DON I want you to feel good about what youre doing but youll never know Thats just the job PEGGY Whats the job DON Living in the notknowing Clients come to me because the notknowing is so unbearable I often make them crazy when I tell them the answer isnt in a book Theres no book I say often nearly preaching Theres no way no path thats been kept hidden from you Some of them get angry when I ask them about their past or whats in their heart But I know that the truest path the only way for a warrior to emerge is through the path of radical selfinquiry the process by which the mask is compassionately stripped away until theres no place left to hide On the roof again watching Chad reassuring him I realize hes gone beyond taking his seat as a CEO Hes grown into something calmer steadier Hed become not merely the man hed always intended to be the man he chose to be but a gentle brokenhearted warrior who leaned into his own pain to find the strength to do what is right Both of us had learned of his termination only a few days before I thought about how he carried himself over those last few days about how despite having been firedhed worked late into the night to get the data right to care for his colleagues to tend to the company as hed always done What would Obama do we took to asking each other in moments when his heart flagged How do you handle yourself on the way out regardless of whether you were given the respect you deserved The back of the warrior is strengthened by knowledge of knowing the right thing to do The soft open heart is made resilient by remembering who you are what you have come through and how those things combine to make you unique as a leader What would Obama do became both a rallying cry and an inside joke What standards of dignity do you hold yourself to regardless of how things unfold What do the people who have counted on you to lead them need from you at this moment These questions shaped our inquiry into how he should handle what had transpired His desire for radical selfinquiry had enabled him to ask and to answer What kind of leader am I Indeed the simple act of asking What kind of leader am I implicitly acknowledges that there is no one way to lead I thought of the allnighters he and his team had pulled missing their families as they faced tasks at handcutting budgets finding the savings Again I thought of Carl Jung I am not what has happened to me I am what I choose to become Looking ahead to how Chad would carry himself as the news became publicas he passed the baton to his successor as he fielded questions from his team his colleagues his coworkers his friends and his familyI knew hed sit regally steady even in his shaky vulnerability I knew he would be transparent about his pain but I didnt realize that the dignity with which he communicated would make him the epitome of grace Turning to his face this weary soul with a beer in his hand his gray hair in need of a trim I could see it more clearly Oh shit I muttered to no one in particular this is his crucible moment This was Chads rite of passage as leadership expert Warren Bennis put it Some magic takes place in the crucible of leadership The individual brings certain attributes into the crucible and emerges with new improved leadership skills Whatever is thrown at them leaders emerge from their crucibles stronger and unbroken Thats the arc Were smacked in the head by the realization that life isnt unfolding as wed hoped that all our careful plotting hasnt protected us from the shock of failure and disappointment Our lives falter Our companies stagger We are in that alchemists crucible and the heat of loss and pain is turned up Were being cooked Our cofounder has quit Our investors pull funding Our number one customer returns the product because it simply doesnt work Our spouse gives up on us Our board fires us Such are the moments to stare deeply into our own experience Who are we What are we made of What conditions are our lives in and radically as important how have we been complicit in creating the conditions we so steadfastly declare we do not want From that place the warrior leader emerges I stare at this gentle but fierce caring but incisive man and realize that he has emerged not only as the CEO he was meant to be but as a man stronger and unbroken His resiliency rises from the very same place that holds his pain His loss is the source of his strength Who knew that his truest most demanding crucible of leadership the moment of his fiercest emergence would come at the end of his first turn in the CEO seat The Crucible of Leadership Learning to lead yourself is the hardest part of becoming a leader Thats one of the things new CEOs and aspiring entrepreneurs come to me for They come because they feel lonely they dont have anyplace else to put the feelings Theyll sit on my couch or pace while they talk on the phone pausing as we grapple with issue after issue after issue Learning to lead yourself is hard because we are wired to look outward We feel pain and we look up and out to see whos hurt us We feel loss and the hurt gives rise to anger as we look for someone to blame Learning to lead yourself is hard because it requires us to look at the reality of all that we arenot to fix blame on ourselves but to understand with clarity what is really happening in our lives Learning to lead yourself is hard because it is painful Growth is painful thats why so few choose to do it Moreover the common denominator in all our struggles is always people When I first take on clients I warn them that I dont have a magic wand Nevertheless their wish for some elixir to mend their relationships is heartbreakingly visceral When we start our leadership journey together my clients frequently assume that the hardest part of their job will be figuring out what to do what strategies to deploy what business models to operationalize Like so many they have been seduced by the notion that being a leader means having all the answers solving all the problems and telling everyone else what to do Selfdoubt convinces us that theres a magic path and if we can only find and follow the yellowbrick road well end up safe warm and happy successful leaders beloved adults retiring in Millionaire Acres at the end of The Game of Life And well never be hungry cold alone or afraid again One of the most profound teachings Ive ever received came from a simple sutra from the Buddha we are basically unalterably good We are born that way And as evidence the Buddha pointed to our humanity Only humans he taught can achieve enlightenment and so simply because we are human we are essentially good But each of us grows seeking love safety and belonging We seek to love and be loved We need to feel safe physically spiritually and existentially And we yearn to belong Learning to lead ourselves is hard because in the pursuit of love safety and belonging we lose sight of our basic goodness and twist ourselves into what we think others want us to be We move away from the source of our strengthsour core beliefs the values we hold dear the hardearned wisdom of lifeand toward an imagined playbook listing the right way to be We are inevitably knocked on our asses by the demands of leading And when we make mistakeswhen we fail to leadour identity our sense of self our selfesteem our deeply held beliefs about what it will take to feel loved and safe and that we belong as well as that most the basic ability to provide for ourselves and our loved ones seems to implode All too often we break down in the work of becoming a CEO a manager a leader But in that breaking is the promise of a making Ive seen it happen before Take Steve Kane for example cofounder and former CEO of Gamesville Back in the old days in June 1999 when I was a venture capitalist and a partner to Fred Wilson in Flatiron Partners wed invested in Gamesville The company was one of the fastestgrowing gaming and entertainment sites around More to the point it was fun One of their bumper sticker logos WASTING YOUR TIME SINCE 1996 A few months after we put a financial stake in the business investment bankers began calling Lets take you public Back then any company with revenue could sell itself to the public capital markets and the investors and founders could cash out It was the thing to do then Whats more Gamesville was going to be profitable Hell we were all going to be rich But then Lycos Inc came calling Back then BGbefore Google as I like to put itLycos was one of the big search engines and they were collecting sites and building out their portal business They offered more than 230 million for Gamesville For Steve and his colleagues it would mean they would be rich and would not have to be subject to the intense scrutiny and unrelenting criticism from public market investors who know little about your company and make money simply on the movementup and downof your stock price The board of directors wanted Steve to reject the deal The collective sentiment was that the company would be better off going public Better off defined as making everyone more money in the short term Steve had his doubts Jerry my Dad worked his whole life building his company I remember him telling me He died and I liquidated the company and gave my mother a check for a few million dollars Taking this deal will mean millions to me and my family he continued Id be a fool to turn this down Years later Steve told me that hed had the great good fortune to learn a ton from working with a father who was an entrepreneurthough he never used that word He was full of juicy fun nuggets of wisdom Steve said things like Never be ashamed to make a profit and The goal is to buy low and sell high not buy lowest and sell highest Months later when we would have been preparing to go public the stock market crashed and the door for IPOs slammed shut for companies like Gamesville Steve had been lucky and prescient Hed also followed his fathers advice to focus on selling high not at the highest and the result was wonderful for him his cofounders and his investors More to the point Steve also become a leader in the process of deliberating over the companys futureand his own His crucible moment wasnt merely that he correctly foresaw that going public wasnt right for Gamesville And it wasnt merely that he knew that a bird in his hand was worth more than the millions in the bush Its that he had stayed in touch with where he was from and what had formed him He remembered that he was the son of an entrepreneur a scrappy endtheday withmoremoneythanyoubegan entrepreneur His dad and my iceman grandfather would have loved to play cards together Or consider Alex one of the first CEOs in whom I invested back in the days of Flatiron Partners Months after we closed our investment in his startup months after the company had been chugging along to build out the service that had been promised in the business plan Alex called a board meeting Its not going to work he told the board two months before the launch I was in shock What I asked myself How could he know this I just know he said as if to answer my silent question He offered two choices pull the plug on the business and return the remaining money to investors or let him fire everyone except for his CFO and give them a month to come back with a new plan If we liked the plan wed use the remaining capital to fund the new business if we didnt wed pull the plug then We chose the second path This twoman operation relaunched the business and two years later we sold the company for five times what we paid to invest Alexs crucible moment was the stark realization that the company wasnt going to work I often think of Alex when I work with clients today That startup still had plenty of cash in the bank The company still had investors who believed in its leadership And it hadnt yet had customers failing to buy the service But Alex had the presence of mind the steadfastness and the courage to confront reality That resolve to do what was rightto offer his investors the opportunity to back out and take back their moneyenabled all of us to pull closer together and focus on executing a strategy that would work Indeed it was his courage and honesty that enabled our group to come together That experience taught me something else about the crucible moment when the leader moves through that moment it enables those around them to grow as well I remember the moment in the board meeting when I realized what Alex was saying I realized that the money I had just invested on behalf of my firm might be lost But while Alex and the other board members were equally scared they believed and trusted each other having first come together in a previous company also led by Alex They believed in each other So terrified that I was going to lose my firms money I too held myself steady I trusted in the honesty with which we faced the challenge Two years later we sold the company for a substantial return on investment But I gained something more than cash I received a powerful lesson in facing reality when something is failing in trusting the team and in holding oneself steady I learned the power of the warrior pose The only answer the only balm against the inevitable existential pain of becoming the leaders we were born to be is to see the lessons implicit in the practice of becoming Thats the true message of Warren Benniss crucible The magic the alchemy occurs when what we do mixes with who we are and is cooked by the heat of what we believe The Buddhists teach that for the steadfast warrior to emerge weve got to break open our hearts to what is The Warrior Stand up I tell him We are in Chads office the minifridge he keeps stocked with cans of seltzer is humming His tiny cloth handmade KEEP ETSY WEIRD banner hangs from his handmade bookcase His guitar rests in the handmade stand I repeat myself Come on Im serious stand up So he stands shoulders slumping His sheepish grin tells me whats on his mind Oh Jerry now what are you going to make me do He trusts me though and hes used to me pushing him Stand with your feet shoulderwidth apart I tell him Straighten up Make your back firm but not tight He complies Now drop your arms to your sides and turn your palms out spreading your fingers His slight swaying slows until his feet are in firm contact with the floor the Earth What do you feel I ask Strong but he hesitates but also exposed Exactly so Strong back and open heart This is warrior stance I tell him The strong back of fiscal discipline The strong back of clarity and vision of drive and direction The strong back of delegating responsibility and holding people accountable The strong back of knowing right from wrong But its also the open heart Its giving a shit about people purpose meaning Its working toward something greater than merely boosting your ego greater than just soothing your worries and chasing your demons away Its leading from within drawing on the core of your being on all that has shaped you Parker Palmer whose grace simplicity and elegance have meant a great deal to me likes to explain the concept of leading from within with a Hasidic tale hes taken from the philosopher Jacob Needleman A disciple asks the rabbi Why does Torah tell us to place these words upon your hearts Why does it not tell us to place these holy words in our hearts The Rabbi answers It is because as we are our hearts are closed and we cannot place the holy words in our hearts So we place them on top of our hearts And there they stay until one day the heart breaks and the words fall in The warrior stance I tell Chad is the only true way to meet reality The warrior stance creates the conditions in which our inner and outer begin to dance together The warrior stance allows us to say Here I am mess and all do with me what you will The toughest aspect of being a leaderhell of being an adultis meeting the world as it is and not as we wish it to be The demons of the world the demons of your soul require just one thing your brokenopen heart Eat Me If You Wish Theres a story told of Milarepa the great Buddhist saint and teacher Its said that one day he left his meditation cave to gather firewood When he returned the cave was filled with demons I like to think of them as little bats flying around the cave making a nuisance of themselves Unsure of what to do he begins to wave his arms at them trying to get them to leave the cave so that he can go back to his meditations in peace But they dont leave Instead they multiply So Milarepa becomes very clever He says to himself I will teach them the dharma the teachings of the Buddha And the demons all quiet down and sit still But Milarepa notices that while the demons are quiet they havent left and their number hasnt diminished Becoming slightly wiser and mildly more adult he asks the demons What are you here to teach me One by one the demons disappear Pleased with himself Milarepa goes back to his meditation but realizes that one demon remains a big hairy bloodcurdling demon with big green eyes and bloody fangs Shaking terrified Milarepa puts his head into the mouth of the demon and says Eat me if you wish With that the demon vanishes Surrendering to the demons that torment you and your organization doesnt mean abdicating your responsibilities to manage You are still responsible for dealing with the reality of what is You are still required to have the strong back for example of knowing when youre wrong In some cases as at Alexs startup the demon is that you have the wrong vision for the company In others it may be that youve hired the wrong people In still others it may be your own failingslike an inability to admit that youre wrong But in all cases allowing yourself to be eaten by the demon that remains acknowledging how you have contributed to the problem without descending into pointless selfflagellationturns up the heat beneath the crucible Without heat there is no alchemy I remember one client a CEO Both she and a cofounder had a host of physical ailmentsmigraines and stomach problems More to the point theyd both argued relentlessly with each other The arguments had gotten so bad that neither could stand to be in the same room with the other Even I was exasperated During one latenight call I asked my client to forget for a moment whether her cofounder was right or wrong I dont care whos right I yelled in frustration The only thing we have to focus on is what are you supposed to be learning from this There was a long silence I thought Okay Youve really pushed her too far You and your woowoo lessons in the pain crap But then alchemy She opened up and put her head into the mouth of the demon This is really shameful to admit she began but I know Im a pain in the ass because I have to be right all the time I know its wrong but I cant stop myself With that we had something to work with I pressed her Given this tendency what do you really believe What values do you hold What kind of company do you want to build And what kind of adult do you want to be Why I asked inelegantly and in a very uncoachlike way Why do you need to be right She released a deep breath a sigh Because if I was wrong my Dad would wipe me out And the tears flowed and the sobs took even my breath away I was never sure I was safe I had to prove myself worthy every night He would grill me over dinner about my day and the choices I had made I learned early on that the only way to survive was to be right Over the next few weeks on guard for her need to be right we carefully went to work changing her approach to the cofounder For her the crucible moment came in facing her shame acknowledging who she really had been As a result she got to choose how she wanted to manage what kind of company she wanted to work for and who she wanted to be as a leader We forge our truest identity by putting our heads into the mouths of the scariest demons the realities of our lives Only by facing our fears our prejudices our passions can we transform the energy that is the source of our aggression the source of our confusion the source of our struggle When I was a young man Id often lament to Dr Sayres about my own fears as a manager After a series of infuriating questions she got me to admit that I was trapped by my own beliefs about success Then came the admission that I would never be satisfied until I was as successful as Bill Gates So many young leaders struggle with the tendency to compare themselves often unflatteringly to betterknown leadersleaders such as Bill Gates or even and despite his controversial character Steve Jobs Years ago Joel Spolsky the cofounder of companies such as Fog Creek Software Trello and Stack Exchange took the Steve Jobs Question headon And yes youre right he once wrote Steve Jobs created one of the most successful companies in the history of humanity and he was a dictatorial autocratic asshole who ruled by fiat and fear But importantly he pointed out you are not Steve Jobs Meaning you are not as bright as Steve was More important though you dont have to be like Steve to succeed I wasnt andimportantly had no need to beBill Gates Indeed I often think of the teaching of Jesus Its a lesserknown teaching from the one of the Gnostic Gospels the Gospel of Saint Thomas If you bring forth what is in you what is in you will save you If you do not bring forth what is in you what is in you will destroy you Jesus taught a truth the only choice that doesnt destroy you is to bring forth who you were meant to be The alchemy of becoming yourself is the ultimate magic act and fullest expression of leadership In all these thoughts I read a steady consistent wisdom the wisdom of knowing yourself and your own beliefs and living them Enduring the alchemical crucible requires developing the capacity to reflect to turn the pain of the everyday life as a leader into lessons Every wisdom tradition Ive ever encountered demands the same thing we must go inward As my friend the poet Pdraig Tuama would say Hello to knowing the story of yourself Thats often the biggest obstacle to becoming yourself The frenzied frenetic do it now answer the email now or the company will die even though its three am attitude is precisely the wrong process of becoming yourself Brokenhearted Warriors Lead Best Back on the roof Chad and I talk of life love and loss the inevitable painful path of change the impermanence of all things The story of my friend Chad is a story of movement of change Its the story of a boy a native son of North Carolina a scholarship recipient at Duke University a true Tar Heel who grew up to be the CEO of a multibilliondollar company And grow up he did Its the story of man whose loss of status has made possible the claiming of something even greater his truest self Thats the greatest crucible of all Learning to bring forth not only what is in you but the whole of you the glory of you as well as the mess of you Taking your seat putting your head into the mouth of all the demons of your life and challenging them to eat you if they wish Taking these steps allows you to take on more than your leadership it allows you to sit like royalty like someone who belongs at the table deserving of having become the person you were always meant to be Hello to humans who occupy the fullnessthe glory and the messof their lives Hello to brokenopenhearted warriors Hello to the leaders this broken world needs most Hello to being the leader you were born to be Hello to warriors with brokenopen hearts There is no one way but there is one requirement to go inward Sitting still hanging out in the spaces between the frames of life speeding by that is the path to radical selfinquiry Journaling Invitations How can I lead with the dignity courage and grace that are my birthright How can I use even the loss of status and the challenge to my selfesteem inherent in leadership to grow into the adult I want to be in the world At the end of my tenure in my current position what would I like to feel about myself Chapter 3 Standing Still in Empty Time I know what its like to be lost I know what its like to be found I want to tell you how to recognize when youre lost I want you to know how to be found I want to tell you how I learned to stand still so that you too can learn to stand still The poet David Wagoner writes The forest knows Where you are You must let it find you To let the forest find you he says youve got to stand still I ended my teen years in the locked psych ward of Cabrini Hospital in Manhattan There are two kinds of psych wards locked and unlocked Those who spend time in a locked ward are considered a danger either to themselves or to others Being on the inside of locked is dreadful Ill never forget the click of the lock falling into place as my friends and family visitors would leave me behind The pain terror and dislocating confusion of my childhood had left me feeling that Id had no other options I was journaling then but didnt have a voice I could only sputter an incomplete and inchoate description of what was going on in my heart Shortly after my eighteenth birthdayon January 2 1982 sitting at my desk in a bedroom in a home in Ozone Park Queens a home my father had inherited from his parents a building theyd purchased in the 1920s a home in which I and some but not all of my siblings lived with our parentsI used an XActo knife to trace lines across my wrists back and forth back and forth until the skin on each side of the line Id traced separated and first tiny drops and then a river of blood appeared A night in the emergency room at Jamaica Hospital was followed by a mandatory three days in Creedmoor State Hospital in a locked room where a burly West Indian attendant stood watch over meI was on suicide watch This was followed by a threemonth stay at Cabrini Hospital behind another locked door One of the ways Id coped with my childhood and teen years was by doing I perfected the art of doing I was busyalways busy In addition to doing well academically through most of my school years I was involved I was involved in plays student government local politics When I ran out of things to do Id take on more commitments The most familiar bodily sensations of my childhood those that didnt involve my being teased and bullied by siblings or kids such as Pablo were those of my heart racing and beads of sweat running down my temples When I left Cabrini I took up where Id left off and began doing again Id moved out of my parents house and into my sister Marys place I got a job as first a busboy and then as a waiter and worked late into the night I went back to school Queens College that September While I was supported financiallyfor example despite her own constraints my sister Mary sent me fifteen dollars a week so that I could pay for therapyI was on my own ending my teen years early I promoted myself into manhood I was behind in my classes so I doubled up taking more than the usual share of credits Whats more despite the incredibly cheap tuition of I recall 750 a semester I never had enough money I took first one job then another and then still another I spent the next few years in constant motion Therapy subway rides classes and work dominated my life Looking back I see all those subway rides all that motion as an attempt to gather lemon drops My twisted logic went like this I didnt have any lemon drops and therefore felt exhausted and depleted and constantly battled migraines because I wasnt doing enough The answer therefore was simple Do more faster I raced through my days From class to therapy to work to class The bus to the train to the bus to the train Sometimes the only sleep Id snatch was on the grass on the quad on campus a pleasant place to rest or in the art library not the regular library that was too noisy Beads of sweat flowed down my temples and the back of my neck My meals consisted mostly of oatmeal it was cheap and temporarily sated hunger Id fill a large thermos with Quaker Instant Oatmeal and eat that all day long One night after a fourteenhour day that included ninetyminute subway rides to and from the Queens College campus I collapsed onto my mattress in the makeshift bedroom Id created in the dining room of the apartment I shared with my brother Dominic I lay there sweating gasping shaking Id fallen asleep in the clothes Id worn the day before I woke a few hours later to the sounds of violence as the bookshelves Id installed as a makeshift closet in my makeshift bedroom ripped out of the wall and everything I owned tumbled down on top of me I lay there covered in jeans underwear Tshirts and twisted metal shelving Breathless Dominic came rushing in Are you all right Yes I mumbled and went back to sleep not even bothering to throw off the piles that had rained down on me A few months later I found myself desperate and anxious The spring semester had started and I had been dodging notices from the bursars office Weeks into the semester I still hadnt paid my tuition I couldnt scrape together the 750 Robert Greenberg was my favorite professor His love of poetry especially that of the Romantics fueled my earliest love of poetry Looking every bit the academic he sported a closecropped gray beard and wore small round glasses beneath his balding head I can still hear him quoting from William Blakes The Chimney Sweeper And my father sold me while yet my tongue Could scarcely cry weep weep weep weep Professor Greenberg was also my adviser One day with the weight of the unpaid tuition bearing down on me I confessed to him that Id be leaving school I couldnt pay my tuition I weep now as I remember his reaction Well thats not going to happen He paused wiping his glasses slowly and then putting them back on Youve just won a scholarship that will pay your tuition until you graduate He explained that he was the only judge in a competition and had decided just then that he couldnt think of a more deserving student The scholarship was given by a small publishing company on Long Island CMP Media had been founded by a husbandandwife team Gerry and Lilo Leeds Lilo who was Jewish had grown up in Germany in the 1930s and left before the Nazis turned the country into a hell She went to Queens College and established the scholarship I was the first recipient At the meeting with her in the presidents office to pick up the scholarship check and take photos for the school newspaper I fasttalked my way into an internship for the summer I began working at InformationWeek a weekly newsmagazine covering technology and business By the end of the summer despite the fact that I knew nothing about technology or business I fasttalked my way again into a parttime job as a reporter Two years later having taught myself a few things about technology and business I finished school and became a fulltime reporter Two years after that having taught myself a few things about leading and managing I was promoted first to news editor and then to editor of the magazine When I was twentyone I had lain under a pile of wornout clothes waiflike and malnourished Four years later at the age of twentyfive I was the editor of a magazine with four hundred thousand readers and a staff of forty The next few years were even more of a blur No Not a blur because of memory or the passage of time They were a blur because motion was followed by more motion beads of sweat were followed by more beads of sweat I still hadnt acquired enough to begin to feel safe but at least I was eating more than oatmeal Looking back now I remember that time as one in which I seemed to barely occupy my body But that realization came later much laterwhen I came to understand that one of the byproducts of standing still is to fully occupy the meat bag that is your body I still remember the feeling of moving through work as if I were the Marvel superhero the Flash Id race from floor to floor meeting to meeting imagining that my cheeks were blown back and puffed out as in the pictures of those guys in the 1960s whod broken the landspeed records I still remember watching my colleagues moving slowly as if they were underwater Even now my heart still races at the thought of closing the last form the last eight pages of the magazine on Friday morning when wed scramble to fit in the latestbreaking news I know now that despite what my frantic mind told me then the constant motion wasnt a requirement of the job Id chosen But producing a weekly magazine with daily deadlines was the perfect job for someone who mistook motion for meaning Everyone thought I was thriving but on the inside I was dying The nonoccupation of my body was obvious to those who cared to look closely I was busy I was alert and active but I wasnt really present in my life My eyes darting from one person to another listening without hearing I wasnt really attending to my life and I wasnt really connecting to the people who mattered most to me In so many ways the world affirmed this way of being I was rewarded with promotions Years later and with the benefit of thousands of hours of introspection I understand why the world affirmed this way of being When I moved fast when I spent my days not truly occupying my life not standing still not being real I found it easier to live in accordance with other peoples expectations By not standing still I was able to be the object of everyone elses projections of who and what I should be Too busy to live my own life I took direction from the affirmations of others Since the world needed an editorial wunderkind to direct a magazine about technology Id readily put aside my love of writing and poetry and took on the mantle of being a technologist My family I thought needed someone who was happy smart and capable and I donned the cape of the good student the fastrising executive who was also everyones friend But this act deafened me to my own voice and numbed me to the urges of my own bodyfor sleep for recovery for love for the poetry that soothes my soul The world loved my doing But the more the world applauded the more my soul ached My soul was a burden bruised and bleeding wrote Saint Augustine It was tired of the man who carried it I was growing tired of carrying my soul This strategy of moving quickly was not unlike another survival strategy I had developed as a child my hyperawareness of the Others sense of being As a boy I could discern Dads mood by the way he walked down the hallway to our groundfloor apartment If he shuffled I knew he was slightly drunk if his shoes clicked on the hallway linoleum then he hadnt stopped at a bar on the way home from work On a good night I could make it to bed before he was drunk Indeed I was always on guard Id listen and watch my parents with great intensity As Dad worked his way through his nightly Pabst Blue Ribbons his words became looser his enunciation less clipped If I was unfortunate enough to be awake before he started his second sixpack of beer I could feel the tension in my mother build She hated his drinking and he drank every night The indications of her mounting duress were less visible but no less visceral Shed light a cigarette and begin moving about the kitchen picking up and then just as briskly putting down objects ashtrays glasses the little replica of Christs crucifixion my brother Dominic had made anything really she touched The ritual movementsnatch it up move it slightly put it downwould slowly spread and deepen in intensity until it felt as if with each puttingdown my whole world was nearing implosion Often suddenly an ashtray would be slammed down and Mom would begin muttering first under her breath and then louder and louder speaking to everyone and to no one in particular No one that is that might be in the room Some nights it was Jesus Some nights it was the late Bobby Kennedy maybe even Art Garfunkel As Gunsmoke or Mutual of Omahas Wild Kingdom played on the black andwhite TV my ears would prick up scanning for the threat As the words flowed and as the night promised to pass in another endless torrent of words the rest of us sometimes all seven of us kids would tighten go silent cower slightly each pretending to just watch the cheetah eat an antelope or Sheriff Matt Dillon capture the bandit without shooting him The worst storms were those when Dad engaged Mom answering her comments about his infidelities his drinking his having been given up at birth to be adopted by Grandma and Grandpa Colonna Over time hyperawareness became part of my character part of me It became as Ive often joked a superpower Even today when I work with coaching clients I track every bob of the Adams apple every pause in the story where it occurs what words preceded and followed it where their eyes move when they pause to brace for the coming storm or even more to discern what they might need right then in that moment If I give them what they need says my little boy they will be saved and if Ive saved them then Ill be safe That hyperawareness married to the quickchange nature of my presentation of self gave me the ability to meet everyones expectations of who I should be My propensity for speed and busyness and my ability to read others were matched by an insatiable curiosity I read constantly I devoured books ideas and information And I asked questions lots of questions Even today the questions I ask can be unsettling When used well people on the other side of the question can feel an uncanny and unexpected sense of being truly seen When not used well they can feel like theyre facing an inquisition with my hypervigilance creeping back up and threatening to break the fragile connection between us These traitsinsatiable curiosity a driving need for speed the ability to read people and the ability to anticipate problems before they ariseled others to view me as a rising star a wunderkind Quite a transition for a guy who only a few years before had been a psych patient in a locked ward And yet even as I progressed in my career the beadsofsweat years continued My Radical SelfInquiry As 1994 began I left CMP left journalism and helped form a venture capital firm CMGVentures At CMG we were among the first firms to focus specifically on opportunities emerging from the newly developed World Wide Web Leaving the media business only intensified those beadsofsweat years Two years later I was on the move again I left CMGVentures to form a new venture capital firm with Fred Wilson On the surface Freds ten years experience as a venture capitalist VC and a Wharton MBA made him the perfect partner for me a guy who could barely read a profitand loss statement But more to the point we both cared as much about how something was done as we did about the outcome Flatiron Partners was founded in June 1996 and the media quickly hailed us for creating a technologyfocused venture capital firm based in New York City We werent the first And we hadnt made any investments so no one could tell whether wed be any good But the press loved the story and we were on the front page of the business section of the New York Times and several other financial outlets A few weeks after officially launching Flatiron Partners I was walking on the beach with my kids Seagulls darted and wheeled through the sky the birds cries mixing with the sounds of the surf pounding the shore We walked through a tunnel under the boardwalk in search of a bathroom and ice cream Stepping into the cool dark I felt relief from the facemelting sun Stepping back into the light I was struck to my knees by a blinding pain that ripped across my skull I fell to the ground writhing I drifted in and out of consciousness and came to in an emergency room No one could make sense of the headache that had ripped through my skull A spinal tap was performed bringing with it a fresh round of nausea After a week in the hospital and a battery of tests the neurologist concluded Probably cluster headaches Probably he said but he could find nothing physically wrong with me Fred my business partner raised a proper Catholic with innumerable ways to feel guilt was convinced that because of the timing of the headacheone week after we had announced the formation of Flatiron it was his fault My thentherapist Dr Sayres had other ideas I sensed that shed grown frustrated by my frequent headaches It wasnt uncommon for me to be woken from a deep sleep with a skullsplitting headache for example Following that incident she began helping me connect the dots between my wakingworld stresses from things such as the busyness the hyperawareness and my propensity to shapeshift to fit the scene often withholding even from myself my most deeply held feelings In those weeks she began pushing me to ask myself one simple question What am I not saying that needs to be said Looking back I realize this time as the beginning of my own radical self inquiry My pain helped me realize that I was lost My soul no longer content to be bruised and battered took charge of my body and grabbed the attention of my conscious mind The headaches which continued even as the selfinquiry began became a way for my body to say in effect Wake the fuck up For if I didnt wake up my soul was going to drop me to my knees writhing in pain In therapy with Dr Sayres we unpacked the months preceding the vomit inducing cluster headaches I was in a job I couldnt stand I was working with people I couldnt trust I was living a life that was not my own I was living as Parker Palmer would describe divided where the inner me didnt match the outer me I was just thirty but already the years of living life at a beadsofsweat pace of moving forward even though I was lost were exacting their price But I was obstinate and thickheaded The lesson that began on the beach that day took years to sink in I put on my superhero cape once again and doubled down on my strategy Flatiron Partners unfolded in glorious ways For years we were celebrated feted Part of that feting seems warranted from all appearances it seemed we could do no wrong Every investment made money But the accolades we received as a firm felt a bit like the affirmations Id received as a rising starfalse in that they were based not on our values our shared sense of purpose but on the whimsy of whether we were making money If there was a conversation about the emerging technology scene in New York we were called Sometimes we were chastised as part of all that was wrong with the growing fascination with all things Internet Nevertheless I continued to move fast and do more I vividly recall coming off the elevator and heading into the office and panting in anticipation and fear of what might be coming at me from around the next corner If Im Not Panting I Feel like Im Not Working Years later Im coaching Victor his shoulders are hunched and hes leaning toward me Hes a potential new client the cofounder of a struggling startup trying to compete in a new but already crowded market Hes come to me in confusion and looking for answers All I have for him are questions What are you not saying that needs to be said Hes got dark eyes thick eyebrows and a full beard At twentyfive hes the same age I was when I took over the magazine at CMP Well Im worried about the money I remember him telling me I mean this first conversation has made me feel great but is it I dont know justifiable to spend the companys money on making the CEO feel better How much can you spend so that it feels justified I dont know he stammers his thick Adams apple bobbing Seventy five dollars Sold I say with a smile He starts to cry What What is it I ask I dont feel worthy Victor is an immigrant He grew up during his countrys civil war He spent most of the years of that war in bed being treated for cancer The wounds from the cancer are in his body still but in his soul as well I dont feel worthy Perhaps it was nothing but some general fear that made him question his worthiness But nevertheless the combination of a devastatingly frightening war and a lifethreatening illness left the boy with the only answer his mind could grasp I am not worthy We worked for a few years as he grew into his role as CEO I watched as the young man became just a manno qualifier needed Toward the end of our time together we began working on his struggles to commit to something beyond work There was a girl They were in love And they fought because she never saw him he was always working What is it I asked Whats keeping you at your desk all night What stops you from I dont know just taking her to the movies Im afraid he barked at me as if it were obvious Im afraid that if I dont work hard Ill end up back there Back there was his code phrase for the war and the cancer Im afraid he continued that if I slow down He hesitated Its like thisif Im not panting I feel like Im not working There it is That same old haunting belief system Run faster and faster telling oneself that the way to be is to do do more faster and just maybe youll outrun war cancer and the other demons that cause you to doubt your worth your lovability and your own voice But panting through work is a lousy strategy It feeds the anxiety of never enough it gets in the way of thinking clearly and it convinces you to mistake motion for meaning Recently I did an interview with a presenter from the BBC He asked in that lovely proper obvious way unique to BBC presenters But isnt working hard just a part of the job Yes Of course I replied But thats not what were talking about Tell me the brilliant ideas the innovations that move an organizationa community of peopleforward that spring from panic and fear When you use your position power agency and the resources of a company when you unconsciously bend colleagues friends and family to serve your hunger for love safety and a sense of belongingoh those longedfor lemon dropsyou stand in the way of finding a mission that unites everyone in the first place Youre not leading when you spend your time trying to outrun your demons trying to numb yourself to the hungers that come from within I understand the impulse Its a rush to well rush from task to task Moreover it feeds a sense of superiority Geez my work must be so important look how fast Im moving But it can also feed distrust and disunity Look how fast Im moving when said by one who holds power implies a profoundly disheartening and negative statement Look at how slowly youre moving A deeper look shows that the view is also fed by a tendency to merge what we do with who we are We are nothing we tell ourselves unless we are doing Our value as humans becomes dependent on whether weve gotten the A in the class raised the funds our nascent startup needs gotten the right accolades from those above us married the right partner purchased the right home I am what I do and if what Im doing is fast and therefore important then I must be worthy enough to have earned your respect your love And if not your love then maybejust maybethe love of my parents While everyonemyself includedcan fall prey to using work as a prop for selfmeaning founders are particularly susceptible to this loss of self Think of the many many jerks in business whom we admire precisely because they have a singleminded focus on execution causing everyone around them to pant their way through the workday Of course we dont put it that way We admire them because they are successfultheir means are justified by their accomplishments The lure of losing oneself in work is immensely seductive Whats more great and impossible things are often achieved through this kind of merging of self with a larger purpose Yes yes yes there is a power in reaching for that largerthantheself purpose Ah but a mans reach should exceed his grasp wrote the poet Robert Browning or whats a heaven for Theres audacity in reaching in dreaming of a new way to change a lightbulb to search for something on the Internet to connect people across time and space That audacious reach should never be withheld But to lose ones footing in the reaching serves no one especially not the one doing the reaching Its a lousy way to live In the fall of 2010 I stepped on a subway at the FortySecond Street station Times Square It was the uptown 1 train I felt myself shoved and looked up angry and startled This was no ordinary jostle The next thing I remember I was lying on my back my head cradled in the lap of a cop my body covered in blood Coldcocked Without provocation without warning Id been knocked unconscious the soft tissue of my nose damaged my cheek lacerated and one tooth broken I couldnt remember my name where I was headed or who the president was Lying on a gurney at Bellevue I was struck by the realization that disappearing into the motion of life losing touch with those inner worlds that define true success is a really lousy way to live It was as if the promise I had made to myself at eighteen in the hospital after the suicide attempta promise to live fullyhad merged with the fears of my childhood I had created a life that was superficially rewarding but slowly killing me On the surface I was thriving during what poet John Donohue would call my emptytime life The gifts of this hollow time included fame and fortune I had gone from covering the news to being news This period had begun to feel like the crucial stage of the most important Monopoly game of my life Look how I had surprised everyone what with my neatly stacked bills and a hidden pile of money How could I possibly quit now The world affirmed me for my willingness my compulsion to give more and more to do more and more But the more I gave the more I lost The more I lost the closer I came to the lip of the stinking belching hole in the ground known as Ground Zero What Needs to Be Said I dont remember the weather but I can guarantee you that to me February 2002 felt dark dank and cold I told my business partners that I was taking a vacation and following my therapists advice booked two weeks at Canyon Ranch in Arizona More important though I began opening to the folks in my life So much of that time remains indistinct but I remember the two books my sister Annie recommended to me Pema Chdrns When Things Fall Apart and Parkers Let Your Life Speak Both books as well as Sharon Salzbergs Faith flew with me to Arizona from New York I spent my time at Canyon Ranch reading learning about meditation and weeping I began to learn the importance of standing still Still enough to begin asking myself that question What are you not saying that needs to be said Annies simple gesture two books with the loving embrace of a big sister altered the trajectory of my life Those books introduced me to two profoundly important concepts Let Your Life Speak showed me that I was not speaking to about or from my life but the life of another When Things Fall Apart helped me see that things are always falling apart always To expect otherwise is to invite suffering Pema taught me that we must lean into the suffering and befriend it Doing that requires just one thing the courage to be still When he was a boy my son Sam loved Maurice Sendaks Where the Wild Things Are just as I had as a boy Sam would listen intensely as I read of Maxs adventures sailing to the wild things Our favorite part was just before the wild things crowned Max king I read And when he came to the place where the wild things are they roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws roaring my terrible roars rolling my terrible eyes and showing my terrible claws and then when the passage came to Max yelling at the wild things Sam would hold up his hand like a cop stopping traffic and would say Maxs famous line Be still When I think of standing still in empty time it helps to think of Sam Be still Sendaks Max and my Sam both knew how to be with Wild Things The only way to tame the monsters the demons with their terrible roars and terrible claws is to be still This is the first step to radical selfinquiry it starts with the courage to be still in the face of uncertainty In the months between my personal Ground Zero my first encounters with Buddhist thinking meditation andfrom Parkerthe experience of a man an elder speaking openly about his struggles I started to regain my life Intrigued by these notions I began to reboot my life I told my business partners I had no intention of renewing my contract That first phase of my life reboot was easier than I had anticipated but my partners response was telling One asked after I told him that I had no idea what I was going to do next but that I was looking forward to life without a title or a business card What if no one calls you I didnt have the courage then that I have now Today I would respond Thatd be wonderful But at the time my willingness to stand in the uncertainty the impermanence of everything was still new The year following Ground Zero was punctuated by my deepening exploration I began a fouryear buying spree on Amazon If it had to do with Buddhism selfintrospection or existential crises I read it But I was still merely a nightstand Buddhist I had read a lot of books but hadnt really leaned into them A few months later I attended a hip fund raiser hosted by two legendary downtown musicians it was a benefit for a local Buddhist center and the beginning of a weekend teaching retreat led by Pema Chdrn Pema with a wide grin on her shaved head settled into a cushion in the middle of the room the teachers seat She immediately started teaching on the nature of things falling apart Its not just the material world she noted All things All Things Our wishes our dreams our conceptions of who and what we are supposed to be our sense of self our sadness our joy all of it Falling apart All the time Right before our eyes And that hurts It hurts because the ego the fragile persona we develop to combat the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and our sense of utter unworthiness believes that only by keeping things exactly as they are moment to moment can we be free of suffering I nodded knowingly I knew how to be a good student Yes I remember telling myself I read about this Good boy I said to myself Then Pema did that thing Buddhist teachers are famous for doing She delivered the coup de grce a whack upside my overconceptualizing head Now she began with a mischievous smile some of you are sitting there thinking I got this I understand this I squirmed But even your understanding of this concept is falling apart all the time I blurted out Thats not fair I had just gotten this concept I remember feeling and youre telling me that I cant even hold on to getting it She turned a twinkly eye to me and said knowingly Catholic right Shed nailed me Once again Id wanted nothing more than to be told how to get an A How to get it right This time though the it was feeling better Later we were each given time alone with Pema With my heart beating fast and beginning to break open in ways it had never opened before I knelt before her the first American to be ordained a Tibetan Buddhist nun I blubbered and stammered The ground had just been ripped from under me and I was falling I tried to explain what was happening to me and Pema or Ani Pema using her honorific title for nun just smiled tapped my hand lightly lovingly and said Honey whatever it is youre not opening to it You think youre open But youre not You need to keep opening Looking back I see now just how terribly lost I was But I also see that I was beginning to find my way beginning to let the forest find me Keep opening Stand still Keep opening and stand still Open up get curious and inquire within Years later after Id begun coaching I came across another teaching by Ani Pema in a tiny book called How to Meditate In it she refers to meditation as the act of stripping away delusion and being with what is simply and wholly That teaching came to mind when I was working with a client Stop the spinning Id blurted out in utter frustration and nearly yelling Stop pitching me Stop telling me youre crushing it youre killing it and that youve got it all figured out I went on If you had it all figured out you wouldnt be sitting on my couch Sit still and ask yourself why things are the way they are and why they arent the way youd like them to be There it was radical selfinquiry The process by which selfdeception becomes so skillfully and compassionately exposed that no mask can hide us anymore Radical in that such inquiry is rare Radical in that it demands that we stop blaming others for our lives Compassionate in the way a good teacher is compassionate stop bullshitting yourself Slow down Stand still Breathe Let the forest find you Then you can begin to ask yourself the hardest questions Who am I What do I believe about the world What do success and failure mean to me and not to everyone else What kind of adult do I want to be And most helpful how have I been complicit in creating the conditions in my life that I say I dont want Creating a Place of Belonging All the folks who come to our companys leadership boot camps complete applications in which they are encouraged to define with skill compassion and radical selfinquiry the things with which they struggle Tracy Lawrences application broke my heart I remember her writing about her wish that the people at Chewse the company she cofounded and where she serves as CEO could be just like software She wanted people to be knowable predictable She wanted some semblance of a guarantee that if the data that had been input were correct the output would be effective In 2016 in a podcast conversation in which we recalled that time she and I spoke of her big breakthrough A breakthrough that came about only because of her willingness to enter a different time to stand still despite feeling as if her hair were on fire to take a few days and think about her leadership and her life At the camp we spoke about the ways our pasts shape our presents We slowed down we stood still we dropped the bullshitting spinning and the efforts to outrun the wild things We inquired within Looking puzzled Tracy struggled to understand how her childhood was present in her adulthood Tell me about shame I answered her Scrunching up her face searching her eyes suddenly got very wide Her body small and still What do you remember I asked I was in middle school she said in a dreamy reverie She was teased relentlessly for having different hair A mixedrace kid her features werent precisely like everyone elses What happened I continued the group joining us in the stillness I spent the entire year eating my lunch in a bathroom stall to avoid the kids who were making fun of me Lunch for Tracy meant humiliation sadness and pain and the only way to be safe was to be alone She wept as she remembered that time She sobbed as she reentered those feelings She sat still and felt the past wash over her Tracy I said calling her back to the present Tracy what does your company do Wiping her nose she looked puzzled Tracy tell me what Chewse does whats its mission We provide nutritious lunches and snacks to other startup companies she answered really puzzled And why is that important I asked Smiling and laughing she replied So that people can get out from behind their desks and gather together for lunch so that lunch isnt painful but loving So that no one needs to eat alone to feel safe Her laugh that followed her realization shook the room with power and grace In the transition from middleschooler to adult from child to startup founder Tracy had buried the memories of those taunts behind a wall of shame glimpsed only occasionally But unknown to her conscious mind she had also transformed that time of enormous pain and selfloathing into a deeply held purpose She was of course providing nutritious meals to folks at other startup companiesher peers if not her friends But she was also giving them an opportunity to belongsomething denied her by the middleschool bullies of her past She reached into a dark shamefilled place in her past and pulled from it a power the power to belong Whats more by stilling her wild things who danced in the moonlight of her memory telling her again and again that she didnt belong she saw that her unconscious had given a way to transform that pain into a purpose In the months that followed that realization she changed the companys mission statement to include the word love and added a heart to the logo She embraced the painful roots of her companys founding realizing that Chewse wasnt merely an attempt to disrupt the food delivery business but an opportunity to give others what she herself had lacked community Chewse then moved closer to a startups holy grail profitability and closed its largest round of financing But most important Tracy no longer wonders why she cares so much about the business succeeding why she worries so much about failure She understands her sacred mission and therefore her core as a leader When you learn to stand still in lost and empty times then the forest can find you and whats more you can find yourself Journaling Invitations In what ways do I deplete myself and run myself into the ground Where am I running from and where to Why have I allowed myself to be so exhausted Chapter 4 Remembering Who You Are It was the first night of one of our CEO boot camps We were in Colorado the aspens were golden under a bluishblack night We were in a circle establishing the safety of this community that over the next few days would come together stand still and begin the process of remembering who they werethe whys behind their life choices The bullshitting stops here I said staring each of them in the eye No more spinning No more lying As I spoke I could feel their bodies tense contract in fear and then relax as they let go and realized that I meant it No more feeding your delusional thoughts about how youre crushing it how youve got it all figured it out I paced the room like the preachers I so admire No more because it only feeds that whispery voice in your head telling you again and again that youre an impostor The next morning we again met in a circle and then sent campers off on a walk with a partner someone they hadnt known before coming to the camp We asked each pair to speak to each other about a single topic What I wish my colleagues knew about me is The pairs returned from their walk more awake more aliveenergized by the connections theyd formed We asked them to speak to the circle and to share their partners story Elbows on knees to steady himself one camper took a deep breath and recounted what hed heard from his walking companion a young woman who had seemed skeptical and guarded the night before What I wish the people I worked with as well as the investors thinking about putting money into my company knew about me is that I have a rare blood cancer and if my treatment over the next six months doesnt succeed Ill be dead within the year We gasped Revealing her secret something only her husband and a few close friends knew spoken aloud broke open her warrior heart Shed kept the secret to protect the people with whom she worked Shed kept the secret for fear that the investors wouldnt fund a dying womans company She carried the burden of that secret so that everyone who had believed in her who had given up so much to help realize the dream of her company wouldnt be at risk if the company couldnt secure the next round of financing In that circle she began to feel the shift that comes from taking your seat as the authentic true frightened deeply feeling adult that you are Weeping she interjected And I thought this was going to be just another boring leadership workshop We burst out laughing joy added to the grief and fear When we stand still we run the risk of remembering who we are When we stop the spinning we run the risk of confronting the fears the demons who have chased us all our lives When we stop the bullshitting the pretending that were crushing it that weve got it all figured out we run the risk of being overwhelmed by the realities of all that we carrythe burdens were convinced must remain secret to keep us and those we love safe warm and happy But the spinning prevents us from being who we really are And perversely prevents the people whom we love the people were trying to protect from knowing trusting and seeing us I know the wish to be seen I know the need to show up to be seen My son Michael and I love movies its one of our things One night years ago we went to the movies He was excited for me to see this film hed read the book and was excited to share the story with me As the film unfolded I saw it as a comingofage story of a young man about Michaels age I even enjoyed the elements that were predictable Settling in I watched the film and enjoyed my thoughts about how the main character was and was not like Michael Then a few minutes before the end of the film the plot twisted And suddenly the film was no longer about a boy like my son but more about a boy like I was It wasnt Michaels life on the screen but mine I lost my breath and panicked I was thrown back in time to my childhood to events Id tried so hard to banish from my conscious mind I wept As the film ended and the lights came up and the theater staff moved through the rows picking up discarded buckets of popcorn I remained frozen in my seat weeping Michael by my side Unfrozen and finally able to move I walked outside with my son and I let us into my car Closing the door and in the safety of the darkened car I wept some more And then Michael said it he gave me the line that showed that despite his young age he possessed a deep wisdom Dad he said you might as well tell me whats going on because if you dont Im going to make shit up and its gonna be negative about me Dad hed challenged me you might as well remember You might as well show up as you are You might as well tell me who you are because if you dont Im going to invent things and those things will stand between us keeping us from being close Until that moment I hadnt realized that this secret was one of the things Id wished those who loved me knew about me Authentic is such a wornout adjective it can feel meaningless I suppose therefore I prefer grammatically challenged phrases such as brokenopen hearted warriors The action that creates true authenticity is embedded in that adjectival phrase But the call is to authenticity The call is to be real to show up mad scared fearless or joyfulor all the above When clients answer the challenge to stand still stop the spinning and be with the truth of their existence they take their seats as warrior CEOs strong backs and open hearts In the months that followed the camper facing terminal illness shared her story with not only a wider circle of friends but also her colleagues and eventually her investors Her community rallied and held herstanding still if you will alongside her The most important part of the story was that the treatment she received worked Shes alive today But another development shouldnt be overlooked In sharing her secret she created the conditions in which her colleagues could share her burden She was no longer the selfappointed guardian of their safety they came together to care for each other I see it all the time When leaders parents lovers choose to share the reality of their heart it gives everyone in their lives the chance to know them to hold themto trust each other Im reminded of another client He came to me worried because after weeks and weeks of assuring his employees that their financing was a sure thing and that a term sheet for a new round of capital was just days away he had to face the reality that the investors had broken their word and were backing away What do I tell them he asked me quaking in fear How about the truth I suggested The truth Are you kidding me If they find out that investors are bailing theyll hit the streets Rsums will be flying out the door Well would you rather they stay for a lie He told the truth and they stayed Not only did they stay but they volunteered to take pay cuts to help the company manage its cash Honey Once again I hear Pema Chdrns voice Honey whatever it is youre not opening to it You think youre open But youre not You need to keep opening We dont stand still because we are afraid of what we will find We dont share whats really going on because we have misguided notions of dutiful caretaking These warped childlike views serve only to exacerbate our isolation and contrary to what weve been taught destroy trust I often think of the moment after weve chosen to stand still as one in which were faced with a threshold a doorway There are of course risks if we share too much Sometimes in the guise of radical selfinquiry we tip over into what some may call radical transparency Too often though we convince ourselves that we are being transparent when what were really doing is shifting the responsibility onto others Here we wordlessly say I cant bear my anxiety so you carry it for a while But I think the far greater risk of standing still opening to what is is that we may end up remembering our name Life at the Top of the Pyramid Shame keeps us from remembering Shame and fear of being humiliated that our inner doubts will be revealed and the persistent whispery voices calling us unbearable names will turn out to have been right all along But an equally dangerous conceit keeps us from taking our seats as brokenopen warriors That is an insidious need to see ourselves as the only one capable to lead So there we sit alone in our struggles burdened by the weariness of all the intellectual and externally generated demands decrying the inability of anyone else in the organization the family the state or dare I name itthe relationship to make a damn decision When working with a group Ill often jump to a whiteboard and draw a simple triangle What is this Ill ask again and again until we zero in on their internalized views of hierarchy And who sits atop this pyramid The bossel Jefeme the president our parents or even God In dissecting this internalized view we reveal how we buy into the trap of the pyramid of a classic commandandcontrol organizational structure out of an attempt to quiet the whispery voices of our perceived inadequacies But it doesnt work The whispery voices in your head know better They know that sitting atop the pyramid pretending to always have it together always knowing the answers is a delusion Moreover the delusion is a double bind On the one hand those voices know that often we havent a clue as to how to proceed In that knowledge we live with the fear of being unmasked as an impostor But on the other hand the shame of our not knowing leads us to believe that everyone else does know everyone else has it all figured out Then we do something particularly clever we turn our shameful fear into further evidence of our failings as leaders as adults as humans So we spin we bullshit and play along in the shell game in which the bean of truth keeps disappearing under swiftly shifting shells We sit atop the pyramid pretending we know Our colleagues outwardly bemoan our inability to delegate and share authority and inwardly revel in the relief that that they dont have to bear the consequences of a poor decision And everyone plays the shell game The game goes on and on Slowly then organizations become a fertile field where we plant the seeds of our childhood struggles Slowly inexorably the topdown inauthentically led group becomes a canvas where we paint out scenes of our past Slowly assuredly team members then respond in kind replaying the struggles of their families of origin Another of Carl Jungs admonitions reverberates Until you make the unconscious conscious it will direct your life and you will call it fate We look at our organizations and logically conclude that they are fated to be dysfunctional messes That we because of our lack of skill are fated to fail as leaders To never feel safe enough warm enough or happy enough Theres the Dad pretending that all is well even as his tense body can only relax with a Pabst Blue Ribbon in hand Theres the Mom talking to Christ not in prayer but as if hed pulled up a chair and were sharing a pack of Winstons And there we are playing the same games of hideandseek half in and half out there but not there And there we all are collectively pretending that the product works the companys future is bright and that we all love and trust each other It was January Id flown back to New York from my home in Boulder for a week of client work The skies were sharp and clear blue and crisp as the skies of Colorado and the heavy gray clouds that normally dominate New York winters were nowhere to be seen I met the senior leaders of my clients company in a windowless conference room The group all twentyfive of us shared the tasks of arranging the chairs into a circle the better to be real with one another No desks or conference tables to hide behind No walls of intellectualized rigmarole to keep us from seeing what was really going on As I often will in group settings I opened the session reading from Lao Tzus ancient poem Always we hope someone else has the answer some other place will be better some other time it will turn out This is it There is no point in peering out a window he admonishes or looking to someone for the answer The answer I told them is right here in the middle of the room So what was the question wed gathered to sort through Why was the company so damned conflict avoidant My client was one of the cofounders and the company itself was incredibly successful In its brief history its gross revenues had grown to more than 1 billion and its business model was being replicated in other categories across the landscape It was striving to blend doing well by doing good As a result the company was in a word beloved But its patina of nice belied a deeper truth Not only were most of the leaders conflict avoidant but like the bootcamper with his greedy head of sales theyd outsourced their unacceptable feelings their naturally occurring aggressions and projected them onto two members of the senior team who constantly battled each other and belittled each others teams Moreover these two each reported to one of the two cofounders personifying and amplifying the split and unresolved conflicts between the leaders Overtly nice and covertly devious the management team led lives of quiet seething anger Quietly avoiding any hint of conflict So nice Pacing the room I probed Turning to one of the cofounders I asked guessing really Did you grow up with a lot of violence at home Violence he asked confirming my word choice No No violence Confused and unsure I turned away And with my back to him he said But we did have a lot of yelling Stopped in my tracks I looked around the room and guessed again How many of you grew up in homes with a lot of yelling Twentythree of the twentyfive employees raised their hands The problem wasnt conflict avoidance I pointed out The problem was fear leftover childhood fears Fear of the consequences of anger And because the most senior people had never acknowledged the ways their leadership styles the choices they made as leaders were rooted in old patterns the patterns were replicated and amplified The problem I added wasnt the two cultural misfits who couldnt get along with each other or the rest of the team The problem was that theyd all collectively bought into the game of hiding the truth Until the leaders embrace the entirety of their pasts until they acknowledge the collective wish to sweep all conflict under the rug the conflicts will be driven underground That doesnt mean theyll stay buried Instead they reemerge with others voicing these roles proxies for others resentments and frustrations It takes a warriors courage to stand still long enough for us to inquire within and remember our past This Being So So What When I was ten my father came home one night just around Christmas and announced that the company hed worked for for thirty years or so was closing and hed be out of a job Watching my father struggle over the next few years bouncing from one unionprovided job to another made me feel that I could never depend on anyone else to employ him Watching my father lose what little selfconfidence he had I swore Id never let that happen to me That viewthat Id always be responsible for my own employmentdefined my career choices As with so many superpowers the view contained both a dark and light side The light side gave me a profound and treasured sense of selfreliance Come hell or high water I could always make money And even if I didnt know how to do something I could learn And with enough knowledge I could do or fix anything The dark side of that selfreliant superpower has shown up as an antsy unease Making it difficult for me to stay put for too long But even that dark side has its own light side The unease has led me through multiple lives Dozens of events shape our careers our lives There are the little conversations at the end of the day over a cup of coffee that reframe everything There are the daily mantras we grow up with that shape our values and our sense of the right thing to do in life And there are the large events like when my father lost his job that cause us to take on a new point of viewa demon if you will In my case that view has sometimes cost me but often caused me to push ahead to try different things to explore to take risks In a way I wouldnt be the man I am today had I not watched my father struggle through his years of un and underemployment and had it not been capped by that fearful advice hed given me about the monkeys ass showing For good or for ill and in fullblown rebellion against my father Ive never been afraid to let more of my ass show Today as a coach I consider myself one of the luckiest people alive I get to help people by listening deeply and holding on to their stories while they do their work And among all the things I find so remarkable are the ways in which our lives are shaped by these conversations from our pasts It helps to understand the stories of our lives It helps to see clearly the ways in which a word or two changes everything Seeing the patterns that ripple out from those tossed stones of events conversations and interactions allows usif nothing elseto remember even more clearly how we became who we are As I often say with my clients a good first step to figuring out where you want to go is remembering how you got here The call to lead well is a call to be brave and to say true things To say to our colleagues were scared but we still believe To say that we may be dyingeither figuratively because the investors dont believe or in some cases literally If were truly to inquire within if were truly to care to look and remember what it is we believe if were to build organizations in which we tell people whats really going on lest they make shit up then we must be willing to open to the reality of life just as it is Several years ago I bastardized an old Zen saying Id stumbled upon Ive repeated my version so often that I cant recall the original But my version feels more resonant perhaps because of my own lifetime of hiding This being so so what Time and again Ive watched hearts break open so that true and authentic leaders can emerge But that process depends on a brave first step facing the reality of what is and not being deluded by the powerful seductive dreams of what can be Of course this doesnt mean theres no role for dreams We need dreams But willfully ignoring what is true is not the same as dreaming Its delusion and delusion leads to terrible decisions and even worse the destruction of trust The first act of becoming a leader is to recognize this being so From that place we get to recognize what skills we need to develop and who we really are and are not as leaders and to share our truth in a way that creates authentic powerful relationshipswith our peers colleagues and families Grant us leaders who can do this and we just may create institutions that are less violent to the self our communities and our planet To open to the reality of life as it isthis is the greatest challenge of all Or put more clearly the call is to stand still and do the work of self inquiry Remember who you are what you believe about the world and then risks be damned lead from that place of brokenopenhearted warriorship Journaling Invitations Who is the person Ive been all my life What can that person teach me about becoming the leader I want to be What was the story my family told about being real being vulnerable being true What do I believe about vulnerability and how might that serve me Chapter 5 The Immense Sky of the Irrational Other We sat at the kitchen table a lit Winston burned in the Bakelite ashtray My dad in his usual seat at the head of the table and I to his right picking at a tear in the vinyl tablecloth My mom in an apron paced around the kitchen walking in and through the swirling cigarette smoke I met Art Garfunkel in the bowling alley on Snyder Avenue My mom talked but it wasnt clear whom she was speaking to I looked up from my bowl of Capn Crunch the spoon dripping milk and braced myself Shit I said to myself shes starting up again Where the hell is this gonna go I tried to catch my fathers eyes but he stared at his opened copy of the Daily News his Parker pen in hand fixing the papers typos Your father was bowling with his league and I was waiting for him to finish up I had bowled a 154 about an hour earlier so I was pretty happy The 154 was my new league high My body tensed I watched Dads reactions Nothing but the scratch scratch of his pen on the paper Anyway I was sitting there waiting for your father when this tall skinny kid with a big mop of hair sits on the stool next to me He was about your brothers age eighteen or nineteen and he was too skinny All the kids were skinny then because they were all on drugs You know that drugs do that dont you She looked at me for permission to continue I nodded Okay so Im waiting for your father and this skinny kid with a blond mop of hair walks in to the alley and takes the stool at the snack bar right next to me Just a burger please says the kid A burger and a glass of water So I asked him Dont you want no fries or nothing Well he turned and looked at me like I was some kind of a ghost or something No he says Real slow and spookylike Are you all right I say to him Well at that he perked up and we got to talking He told me his name Garfunkel he says Art Garfunkel It was a pretty funny name so I never forgot it Later when I heard it all over the place I knew him I nodded Anyway Thats why he wrote that song because of me You know Mrs Robinson Thats me Im Mrs Robinson Fuck Is it me I asked myself silently Am I crazy Dad I said out loud trying to disrupt her flow No response Dad Whaaat He looked up from his paper and into my eyes In the silence with my eyes I pleaded with him to do something to say something He shrugged I finished my cereal washed my bowl at the sink and turned to look at her An apron covered her burntorange sweater and polyester slacks Shed lit her own Winston and taken a drag on a cigarette the exhaled smoke encircled her head Slowly coldly to reassure myself of the ground beneath my feet and the reality of my world I turned to my mother You are not Mrs Robinson I stared at her daring her to say something She stared back with only a sliver of recognition of who I was Hey hey hey said my father Dont talk to your mother like that Like what Dad this is crazy Your mother is not shes not just dont talk like that Just dont upset your mother Dont Dont Dont Upset Your mother Dont I stood and walked into my room I wrote a note to my brother John I cant take it Not sure when Ill be back Not sure if Ill be back Kookookachoo motherfucker kookookachoo Kookookachoo get me the fuck out of here I grabbed my jacket and headed out the door Choking on the words I wanted to shout back I ran out and away making my way to the A train to Brooklyn to Coney Island Being fifteen was hard I often found myself pushing back against my father against my mother against a world that was confusing insensible infuriating and frightening It was a time when Moms crazy irrational rants frightened me less while Dads shrugging shoulders and his Whatareyagonnadobout it ways enraged me more Dont talk like that hed say over and over Youll upset her Dont upset your mother Whatever you do dont upset your mother In the shadow of the Wonder Wheel I hid amid the seagull shit and axle grease at its base where as I once wrote in a poem I hid my heartburied it if you willin the sand beneath the boardwalk I was hiding and yet again wishing to be found My fathers fearfilled admonition was seared into my body like a brand I distinctly remember one of the few times he and I ever talked about it about what her crazy rants did to him He told me of the toll it took on his body but as with so much about my mothers illness it was only obliquely referred to approached from an indirect angle Like so many times before we sat at the kitchen table another burning Winston in the black ashtray My father had taken his seat and I mine pulling at the white cotton threads beneath the torn vinyl tablecloth After hed lost his first job he was low man on the totem pole and the best the union could do was get him work at another printing company Every night precisely at nine thirty hed call home from work to see how we were all doing I never knew what to expect he told me I never knew if your mother would be upset or not Sometimes I was so scared that my gut would clench and I would get the runs Like so many of us I cared for both of my parents So much so that I inherited my fathers gutclenching fear Dont upset your mother entered my body and came out as Dont upset the Other It manifested as an obsessive vigilance wherein I learned to watch the Others every step every breath every pause or furrow of a brow for clues as to what they might say or do next The vigilance was honed until it became if you will a skill a superpower all in service to not upsetting the Other In the process of our becoming the admonitions of our parents the rules by which our families operated and created a sense of belonging become the rules upon which our survival depends Dont upset your mother carried not only an implicit warningit is dangerous to upset your mother but a guideline for dealing with the world with other peoplewith the Other even those we see as crazy Dont upset the Other To belong to be a member of the tribe safe from being thrust out of the only home we know we internalize the task of making sense of the Other Then when the Other acts irrationallyor importantly with a rationale that we cant discern we get ensnared in a logical trap Its dangerous to upset the Other So our job is not only to keep the Other from becoming upset but to bring the Other back to making sense to not being upset We become the guardians of those who should be protecting us We task ourselves with being the firm ground upon which they can stand despite their unsteadiness Cold scared confused and under the Wonder Wheel at the age of fifteen I began for the first time to see the futility of trying to engage with the Irrational Other I began to see the trap I stood up shouting Fuck I turned to the sea and declared This is not going to be my life and fell to my knees shaking sobbing Looking back now I see that moment as a declaration of freedom an intention to free myself from the patterns of behavior and belief that had been shaped by my family life When I returned home later that same evening my father was shocked he hadnt even noticed Id been gone My brother John met me in my bedroom Are you okay Yeah I said We hugged and we cried Dont do that again he said laughing and crying Dont you leave me he added But if you do youd fucking better take me with you I watched him walk away and turned to rip a page from my blackand white marble composition notebook my journal I wrote a note Its absolutely irrational to try to argue rationally with someone who is being irrational I pulled a photo from a bent clear Lucite frame tossed it aside and slipped the note inside leaving it on my dresser top where I would see it every day for the next few years To hell with not upsetting your mother To hell with not upsetting the Irrational Other I was not going to live that life under the weight of my fathers gutclenching runsinducing fears Looking back over the decades that followed I came to understand that this wasnt merely my work To be free each of us must come to understand the causes and conditions of our childhood For these gave rise to the rules by which we as adults livethe rules whose original purpose was to keep us safe and that create the conditions we desperately want to change Ghosts in the Machine Software developers borrowing from writer Arthur Koestler define left over outmoded code nolongeruseful subroutines buried deep within a current version of a program as ghosts in the machine While once useful this outmoded coding starts to get in the way of current operations Like everyone I have millions of lines of such code operating instructions for how to navigate the world and relationships which add up to hundreds of ghosts in the machine of my mind When I encounter an irrational person I still avoid arguing My first impulse is to stifle my feelings When that fails I flee I physically leave But if I cant physically remove myself I disassociatethe true me will hide and the meat bag of me will stay put hidden but not hidden there but not there When those strategies fail Ill turn to making sense of the insensible and try to comprehend the incomprehensible My journals are filled with diagrams of arguments lawyerlike briefs and lots and lots of enumerated points as if Ive become a trial lawyer a prosecutor extracting some odd sense of justice Journaling Constantly journaling Replaying again and again the scenes of the irrational encounter refining ex post facto rationales I could have used should have used My ghosts shape every aspect let alone every relationship of my life but theyre most powerful when I encounter the Irrational Other The Irrational Other What makes the Other irrational Sometimes its because theyre downright crazy they are dealing with extreme disorders of the mind But more often its simply because the rules they live by the ghosts in their machines are simply different Even then its more than simply the differences that can cause each of us to seem irrational to someone else Usually the lack of awareness the lack of understanding of why we do what we docoupled with our inability or unwillingness to explain the roots of our rulesconvey the sense of irrationality A cofounder may look at my extreme vigilance for example and see only a replication of my fathers obsessive focus on correcting others mistakes their typos Without my own radical selfinquiry and further my willingness to explore that tendency in the safety of an adult relationship theyre left without the understanding that that passiveaggressive correcting is rooted in the effort to stay safe Moreover without my own exploration of the roots of that I stand little chance of changing behavior others find irrational and frustrating In my attempt to feel safe and that I belong I may inadvertently drive away the very people who could best help me feel loved safe and that I belong These ghosts in the machine maintain themselves the coding replicates and mutates embedding deeper and deeper in the relationships that define our loves and our lives Encoded in the operating systems of our minds such ghosts unconsciously determine who gets chosen as our partners and precisely the ways they drive us nuts Moreover the places we work our professional lives can also become a suffocating web of complex reenactments the tripwires of past traumas laid out where unsuspecting colleagues are bound to trigger us Dealing with what Ive come to see as this neverending supply of Irrational Others is the number one challenge facing many of the entrepreneurs with whom I work I just cant deal with him she says I sense her pacing the floor as she speaks to me on the phone He says hell do something and then he up and leaves Hell leave early on a Friday Or worse tell me that hes headed out for vacation and then delay his return despite assuring us all that hell be back in time for the work Her breaths came faster and faster as she shared her frustration and when he does finally return he says nothing about his broken promises Shes CEO and the he is her cofounder Theyve been together for years Ive been working with the CEO for just over a year and in that time occasionally had sessionswalks and deep talkswith her cofounder Despite the companys success it still felt stuck mired in a swamp of indecision infighting and toxic backbiting To the folks who interviewed for jobs at the company the place seemed idyllic The beautiful offices hummed with a lively and genuine care for their work in the world But after months of working together and developing trust with my clients colleagues I sensed their feelings too of a subterranean wrongness pervading the office The wrongness in the office presaged the wrongness the something is off in the relationship between my client and her cofounder But like the office by all outward appearances the relationship was idyllic Yet in private each thought the other was at fault Sorting it out was more than just a matter of sorting through the she saidhe said more than a matter of picking a side and saying who was right Id stepped into a deeply codependent relationship akin to the most dysfunctional marriages Ive known where each side of the pair called the other stubborn closedminded and irrational Her impulse like the impulse of nearly all my clients was to analyze the Irrational Other to figure out what was wrong with them so that they could be fixed changed made better That was often a cover for another impulse which was to figure out what was wrong with the Other so that they could justify the ending of the partnership overcoming guilty feelings Thinking back to my bootcamper and his greedy head of sales I asked the CEO a similar question Okay if hes so awful why after all these years havent you fired him We began to unpack the relationship How did it begin He was a visionary she shared I needed him so much She told stories of latenight gripe sessions and even laterintothenight sessions of plotting their escape from the European Global 100 company where theyd worked In the earliest days there was a third a mutual friend who was the technical genius The three of them had made a great team What happened to the friend I asked Oh we kicked him out after the first yearhe wasnt pulling his weight Three becoming two made me curious What was at play here What was really going on in this relationship To be clear the companys work had been amazing Theyd built an incredibly successful company They were making a difference in the lives of millions of people Still the undercurrents of dissatisfaction and resentment were as much a part of the culture as their expressed desire to create something lasting and beautiful A breakthrough came when my client described how uncomfortableher wordshe was when her cofounder had approached her with some genuine and authentic concerns Earlier in the week Id encouraged him to speak directly with her In doing so hed triggered a level of contempt in my client she had not realized shed felt for him Worse than promising something and failing to deliver was having him cry and tell me he was scared she said nearly yelling and clearly angry with me I think I need him to be disappointing and emotionally distant I reflected back to her what shed just said You need him to be a disappointing and emotionally distant man Oh fuck she said seeing a connection a ghost in her machine Hes my father Her father was a man whose ability to be emotionally present depended on alcohol whose drinking often ended in long unexpected disappearances and whose returns were marked by a terrifying secretiveness since neither of her parents ever spoke about the fact that Dad had disappeared It was and is much more complex than that of course But that was and is one deep and unconscious component of their decadelong codependency She needed to have a partner who in effect promised her freedom He was a visionary We plotted our escape together He wouldnt mention his broken promises but disappointed her time and again with the greatest disappointment being the untrustworthy illusion of emotional intimacy On his side he needed to disappoint the incharge takecharge woman who saw in him a promising future He was unconsciously compelled to repeat his childhood scenes of having a mother whose wishes for her son would be dashed time and again Theyd tried for years to break the dynamic Theyd hired consultants to redo their tiny organizational structure thinking the root of the problem was that they were not dividing the work between them well enough All the time neither suspected that the feeling of being stressed by too much work and not enough time was in fact hardwired into their relationship As part of the complex familyoforiginbased coding they each needed to blame the other for the continuous sense of not having enough time If only they worked hardersmarterlonger then I wouldnt be so stressed Once we laid bare the roots of the antipathy between these two people who loved each other we began to see the ways other encoded messages dictated the cadence and rhythms of their lives The ways for example they unconsciously excluded any third person from becoming a senior member of their team thus inhibiting the growth of the business Ten years after founding the senior team consisted of well the two of them Or the ways in which they would eachconfidentially of courseshare a perspective on the real goingson at the business Or the ways that despite their constantly complaining about the other neither one was taking ownership of his or her part in the mess of their relationship The fingers always pointed at the other the inquiry never went inward All those ghosts in the machine forgotten but still operating subroutines outliving their usefulness and limiting our growth I think of the pair of venture capitalists who tied their fates to each other One my client was by all appearances kind caring thoughtful and beloved His founding partner Irrational hated by the communities of entrepreneurs and coinvestors with whom their firm did business I fielded questions from throughout the startup ecosystem Why would he my client pick that guy as his partner That guys a jerk Fewincluding my client until we unpacked itunderstood that the jerk provided a muchneeded bad guy for my goodguy client to hang out with Always the good guy who did what was expected my client needed to have an evil doppelgnger with whom he could do drugs and party all night If he drives you crazy if he risks the firm your reputation and everything that youve built I asked him one day why do you keep him on He laughed Through the laughter he said I have no fucking idea And he laughed some more I pointed out the laughter and asked How old do you feel Startled he said I dont know but I feel like Im in middle school getting away with pranks and hoping not to be caught From that brief recollection of a feeling we unpacked the ways he was a good Catholic boy an altar boy a choir boy and that what he really wanted to be was a cool kid His badass partner made him feel like he was finally a member of the cool kids club even as the adult in him recognized the danger When the Irrational Other is a sibling or a romantic partner the complexities quickly multiply I think of three different pairs of siblings cofounders whose decadesold struggles were rooted in latenight sharedbedroom arguments over whom Mom and Dad loved more Think of the sibling rivalries no longer playing out over Hot Wheels and the unfairness of chores but over product direction and whether the company should take money from a particular investor Stepping into a first meeting with one particularly troublesome pair of siblings I had to shout to be heard over their argument Thrust into the role of a refereeing parent I remember laughing as I reprimanded them Stop it Stop this fighting or Im walking out and never coming back And one brother a thirtyyearold man looking up with sheepish eyes and a hangdog face saying But he started it Yeah asked the other Well youve been doing that to me my whole life They said this in the boardroom of their fourhundredperson company Or when one sibling takes the seat as the CEO and the other as the head of product The lines of authority should be clear but they arent because the producthead sibling is also a board member and he is technically his siblings boss The challenges for business partners who are also life partners have a unique expression of this consciousunconscious dance One or both partners may feel both manifestations of the partnership life and business affected by ghosts from the family of origin past romantic relationships andor past work experiences One client a woman Ill call Virginia was the founder and CEO of her company Growing up admiring a thoughtful successful but emotionally distant entrepreneurial father she tried to emulate her fathers style Shortly after founding the business the CEO began dating her chief technical officer A little later they married The tensions around emulating her father including his emotional distanceled all her employees including her CTOhusband to never know where they stood and thus to assume that nothing they did was ever good enough for Virginia Despite the insistence of the irrationality the wrongness of the Other we are never truly alone in our relationships We are always accompanied by our ghosts As in so many relationships this complex interweaving of self and Irrational Other relies on a combination of psychological transference The Irrational Other becomes a standin for someone in our lives usually from our past They become a screen onto which we project our negative and positive qualities those we cant allow ourselves to acknowledge as our own One partners understandable impatience and focus on effectiveness strike us as irrational because it reminds us of the ways we constantly disappointed a parent That irrational behavior then triggers our shame causing us to withdraw hide or make a process overcomplicated increasing the Others sense of impatience But the merrygoround of transference and projection doesnt stop there Often our unconscious will work to preserve the disappointmentshameful hidingmore disappointment structure because buried deep within us is the belief that however miserable the complex may make us at the very least it tells us were alive To the child who lives within us and according to the ghosts in the machine these complex duets feel like home The drama and the misery tell us were safe We know this pattern because weve been tracing it all our lives When I can sense a complex structure such as this is at work behind the incessant complaining about the Irrational Other my work shifts to helping the parties see the ways the complex structures may have outlived their usefulness Put down the script Ill tell them You dont have to be an actor in that drama anymore The Immense Sky I dont want to play anymore Im whining and I cant help it I want to hand back the script and stop playing the role This time Im speaking with Sharon Salzberg Years after her book Faith broke open my heart shed become my teacher and someone I sat with in meditation on a regular basis Someone who could help me sort through the ghosts in my machine ghosts who would make decidedly unforgettable appearances following meditation sessions Were discussing yet another agonizingly perplexing relationship in which Im twisted trying to make sense of my fears that the Irrational Other will explode in anger Dont upset your mother bounces in my head All beings own their own karma Sharon reminds me referring to the Buddhist law of cause and effect their happiness or unhappiness depends on their actions not my wishes for them All beings I realize including my mother including the Irrational Other With lovingkindness for myself a powerful lesson from Sharon I allow all the feelings of the irrational perplexing agonizing relationship to wash over me Suddenly I see it clearly my whining my sense that Im trapped by this relationship my seeming powerlessness over the irrationality of the Other are reenactments And with that observation Im suddenly freed from the burden the trap of trying to make the irrational rational Not only is it completely irrational to argue with the Irrational Other its irrational to try to alter them so that they make sense to me In that moment I realized that we all have a choice in the experience of the Other We can remain stuck Or we can allow the Irrational Other to provoke us to wake us up to the repetition of painful habits andwith love and understanding for ourselves and an embrace of the ghosts in the machinewe can move past any fear or shame and take a step on the path of awakening We ask How indeed have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I dont want More to the point what am I willing to give up to stop being complicit The poet Rilke warned that to love another is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks He also said that implicit in being in a relationship with the Other is the possibility of always seeing each other as a whole and before an immense sky But doing so demands realizing and accepting that even between the closest people infinite distances exist Within those distances beneath that immense sky lies the possibility of our deepest most radical selfinquiry How am I complicit in creating the conditions I say I dont want The key to understanding is seeing clearly your own reaction When you react with anger fear greed or even with laughter as in the case of my client and his wish to be bad it gives you a chance to see yourself more clearly Radical selfinquiry is the path to seeing habits and patterns Questions that drive us toward that insight are endlessly helpful What parts of me are being projected onto the other person How do I reclaim those parts of me What do my reactions say about me Why do I do what I do Why do they do what they do What need for love safety or belonging might they be trying to meet with their irrational behavior Awakening is damn hard When our wires are tripped and the ghosts of the past screech Its happening again its damn hard to stand down to stand still and inquire within How can we disregard our fiery demand that the Other apologize stop their nonsense at once and change forever If in response to the failing disappointing Irrational Other we are able to inquire deeply and name what it is were seeing whats really happening for us were often able to break the spell cast by our ghosts How Am I Complicit in Creating the Conditions I Say I Dont Want Ann was struggling mightily Her cofounder Paul was in her words incredibly indecisive and buffoonish and slow Even though she was the CEO he as the head of strategy for the company used his position as a board member to lord it over her she said and disrespect her by telling her what to do Ann and Pauls friendship went back to college and when they finished up graduate school both Harvard Business School alums they decided to launch a business together Theyd sat up late night after night with white sheets of paper sketching out ideas Anns a natural executer Paul told me the first time we met Im all about the big ideas but Ann really gets shit done It made sense that she should take on the responsibility of being CEO he added because he knew she was simply better at making the quick decisions But lately shed been making too many decisions without consulting him and not only had he felt steamrollered but the oncecritical balancing act between their decisionmaking styles no longer worked He felt diminished and disrespected Their differences seemed irreconcilable Having worked with each of them I know each of them was speaking a truthat the very least their feelings were true even if objectively the facts were slightly different from the perspectives they held I encouraged them to use the practice of mindfulness as a form of radical selfinquiry to break the spell gripping each of them and to alter the course of their interactions Unbeknownst to each of them I had given them the exact same instructions when theyd emailed me about how irrational the other was being Using a particularly incendiary email exchange with its ever escalating anger I encouraged them to put down their weapons to put down their phones When the ding notifies you of a new email I wrote to each of them Dont answer it Dont even look at your phone I told them to sit taking note of every feeling that came up especially the bodily sensation Note the desire to read the email and note without jumping in giving in the stories you might tell yourself about what the e mail contained When you find yourself following the story ask yourself a question about your body Where in my body does this story live The point was to encourage them to widen the gap between the stimulus the ding and the response I cant believe how wrong heshe is Shehe never respects me It was so painful Ann told me afterward I felt heat rising from my chest and going to the top of my head I was like one of those cartoon characters where you see the head turning into a teakettle and steam coming out the ears She laughed as she recognized the deep Pavlovian call to up the ante and once again explain how wrong Paul the Irrational Other was Instead of steam Paul reported crying I was so overcome by this deep deep well of sadness It filled my entire chest cavity How old is that sadness I asked him Very old he said between sobs Its me being slapped one more time by my mother Me being told once more that Im just not good enough Later in a joint session I asked each of them to lean into their awful spiky pain those ancient tender spots Stay with the bodily sensations I told them Notice but dont board the train of the thoughts that pulls into the station See the stories youre telling yourself about the other I continued What do those stories reveal about the stories that you might have been holding quietly silently for all your lives We sat in painful silence as they both looked down and straight ahead After what seemed like an eternity Ann spoke first That Im cold uncaring and focused only on the next step ahead never on the people I say I love Who told you that story Ann I asked My exhusband He said this was why he could not stay married to me We honored the weight of that revelation with more silence We gently turned to Paul Ive not lived up to my potential he stammered And never will Nodding leaning forward my elbows on my knees How old were you Paul when that story first landed in your body I was so fucking little I cant even recall not feeling this way Suddenly the air flowed again in the room All three of us were breathing Speaking to the two of them I asked Did you know that this is what your friend believes about themselves They looked at each other and I saw two old college friends no longer the CEO and her cofounder They saw again the two crazyassed entrepreneurs who had the audacity to try and change the world They saw the Other no longer irrational For this is one of the opportunities that the Irrational Other presents to stand beneath the immense sky and see the Other as whole yet disturbed by his or her own ghosts Growing up this Other could never feel safe The family system ensured that they could never ever relax Their blend of hypervigilance was designed to do the same thing as mine keep them safe Slowing down or better yet standing still and paying mindful attention to oneself allows one to see past the projections the stories we tell ourselves about the Other asking once more How am I complicit in creating the conditions I say I dont want The most painful gift of the Irrational Other then is the opportunity to see ourselves better Their irrationality stems partly from our having projected onto them the good and the bad traits that are really ours to claim Seeing their irrationality in this way is like encountering our reflection in a Coney Island funhouse mirror Its us we see but distorted into a funny scary imago of ustrue but not accurate and frighteningly distorted If as JeanPaul Sartre observed hell really is other people then the truest hell is seeing ourselves in that irrational distorting mirror Relief can come though when we gaze at this distortion as if seeing the immense sky containing all our positive and negative traits as well as those of the Other What is it about your cofounders failures as an entrepreneur that disgust and enrage you Was it perhaps because she saw in him the fact that not only was he not keeping her safe but that she like him was failing Ann heard something Paul never intended to communicate through his actions Paul saw in Anns responses the distorted reflection his own worst feelings about himself If we gaze at that distortion with the mindful curiosity implicit in the self inquiry process we can breathe in the reality that each of us is whole disturbed merely by fragments of leftover codeghosts From beneath such a sky we begin leaning into other radical selfinquiry questions We get to choose actively our experience of being with the Other rational or not What are your operating instructions I ask the next pair of cofounders who come in with their conflicts When the ghosts screech at you when your tripwires are triggered what do you do Do you retreat Do you lash out More to the point how would you like the Other to respond to you Can you give instructions to dial down your fear and anger And for extra credit when youre responding from your most resourced placewhen you feel loved and safe and your belonging is not threatenedwhat if you were able to give that feeling to the Irrational Other What if all he needs is silent understanding and the guardianship of his solitude so he can work through what his ghosts are demanding he work through Jerry Im going crazy Eliza wrote to me Please can you possibly make time for me A new client Eliza is the cofounder and CEO of a tiny but fastgrowing company When we first met the company had twenty employees Seven months later they had forty She had just hired her first chief technology officer and it was about him that she was looking for help He was the Irrational Other Whatd he do now I asked her He always does this He always leaves without getting his work done and he always leaves without even telling me hes leaving Hes so disrespectful I think its because Im a woman Taking a breath I asked her to tell me more about feeling disrespected I know how he feels she said trying to stand in his shoes He cant stand working for a woman Thats true I said noting that unconscious bias is even more rampant than overt sexism But why would he have taken the job I knew shed just hired him and that hed accepted the job after turning down higher paying jobs elsewhere He had told me and I was convinced that he was genuine that he really admired my client and was excited to work for her I suggested she use a tactic I learned from training in nonviolent communications OFNR O for observation of undeniable fact F for feeling and assumptions about motivation and other interpretations of facts N for needsindividual as well as collective needs R for request a request for an alternate way of behaving Start with the facts I told her He left the office earlier than expected and he did so without telling anyone Then I explained further share how his doing so made you feelin this case disrespected Then share with him the collective need that everyone in the company has a need to feel respected Then I told her make a request If he needs to leave early ask that he let you know in advance It worked she wrote to me a few hours later It turned out that hed gotten an emergency call from his wife their fouryearold daughter had had a raging temperature and needed to be rushed to the hospital He hadnt said anything about why he was leaving he shared because he didnt want to appear weak like he was putting family ahead of the job Can you believe he thought that putting family ahead of work is something I would think was weak she asked Yes I could I wrote back Hes got a ghost in his machine just as you have a ghost that tells you when someone does something unexpected and possibly threatening its an existential disrespect Forgiving the Irrational Other From Eliza to Virginia to Paul and Ann and the good boybad boy doppelgnger investors each clients experience of the Irrational Other offered the chance to grow They used the awful painful experience of being in a relationship to grow up and beyond the confines of their childhoods In looking in the funhouse mirror the Other presented they saw their ghosts and in doing so got to see the fullness of the Other Looking backward I see the brokenness of Moms childhood as the source of her later irrationality It took years of work but I had finally come to see her ghosts and the way they haunted her Indeed when I squint I can see her father Dominic Guido in his fear and bewilderment feeling so helpless as to at times lash out violently Looking backward standing side by side beneath the immense sky I can see her as whole but brokenhearted Confused scared even standing beneath her own Wonder Wheel trying to make sense of an irrational world In seeing her my archetype of the Irrational Other as not so irrational but merely human I get to see myself in exactly the same way Late in 2015 after a neardeadly fall we brought Mom to a nursing facility where she would die a year later Shortly after getting her settled into the home I flew to New York to visit her Shocked by her frailty I remember thinking that her hair which was always so important to her wasnt right It was flat not teased into an updo as itd normally be It seemed if possible even whiter The reality of her eventual death and all that had happened between us seemed frozen in that moment Here she was the scary irrational crazy Other the woman whod time and again left me questioning my own sanity and sometimes my desire to live She was weak confused scared in her own right Her eyes searched my face as well as the faces of my kids I see her no longer as the Irrational Other but as the woman who rose each Sunday to make a fresh pot of tomato sauce for our Sunday dinners In those scared eyes I see her strength her ability to overcome the pain and trauma of her life the unfair and irrational pains she had to suffer Suddenly the smell of the antiseptics of a nursing facility are replaced by the mouthwatering fragrance of fresh meatballs stewing in her sauce I remember so much I remember as the pot bubbles Dad with a copy of the Sunday edition of the Daily News Whos got the comics hes just asked I havent finished the puzzle yet As I stand over her bed watching her watch my kids scanning my face her eyes asking Whats happening to me I remember long dark walks from our house in Queens to the subway to the A train She and I passing Oxford Bakery with the bakers in the kitchen and the street filled with the smell of apple turnovers and crumb cake German bakers shed say theyre the best In those months after she and I moved in together and before my father and brothers Dom and John came to stay with us together just she and I would climb the steps to the elevated A train Every morning at five thirty so she could get to her receptionistfile clerk job on Wall Street and where I could make it to school in Brooklyn by eight Wed sit together on the subway the heaters below the seats warming our bottoms and calves Leaning into each other Id fall asleep on her shoulder safe warm and filled with the smells from a German baker Back in the nursing facility I am both here with her in the months before she has died and somehow back there where the anger and suffering scared me However old the trope may be I feel my fathers presence over my shoulder Though dead for more than twentyfive years hes with us now He whispers in my ear something hed written to me back when I was in high school It was the night before the opening of a show One of the few stage appearances of my life the year before Id been picked to play Oberon the fairy king in Shakespeares A Midsummers Nights Dream Using his treasured Parker pen hed written me a simple note Even to this day I can see that looping handwriting Good luck hed written or as they say Break a leg And then after a space on the little sheet of yellow paper hed added No one could be prouder of you than I am right now I carried that note in my wallet until time and age had disintegrated the paper its message etched forever into my soul Back to Mom lying there scared and confused I thanked Dad for his reminder and I leaned in speaking directly into her hearing aidless ear and said Its gonna be all right Mom I love you I forgive you Whaaat she said Through my tears I laughed Of course she couldnt hear it It didnt matter I felt it Recalling that moment now thinking about my time in Coney Island as well as all the times I ran away literally or figuratively Im flooded by not only forgiveness but crazily enough gratitude If I had not encountered Moms irrationality if I had not actively but unconsciously sought out time and again the ability to reenact being in relationship with the Irrational Other I would not have discovered my deeper self and all the rich resources that are waiting for me to deploy Im sure I would have been a good person without the rigors of the Irrational Other I am a good man But without those struggles I wouldnt be me And the truth is I like being me So thank you Mrs Robinson Journaling Invitations Why do I struggle with the folks in my life Why are relationships so difficult What am I not saying to my cofounder my colleagues my family members my life partner that needs to be said Whats being said to me that Im not hearing Chapter 6 Handprints on the Canyon Wall I am closer to the age when my father died than I am to the age when I first became a father That thought like a whisper on the wind startled me as I walked around Wonderland Lake in the foothills of the Rockies As the midmorning light slanted toward the hills calling forth their very best pinks and grays as the overnight dusting of frost sparkled on the flat lake water and crunched beneath my shoes the thought gnawed at me As I approach the age when my father passed away I think of how the repetition of patterns creates a delicate intriguing symmetry in our lives I passed from being the young son of a young man to being a young man to being the young father of a boy then a girl and then another boy Each of them adults now in their own right my oldest is the same age I was when I became a father and soon after said goodbye to Dad Reverie interrupted by questions Step step crunch Who am I becoming Step step crunch What do I believe to be true about the world Step step crunch As Im becoming an elder Now what should I do with my life now that I am becoming an elder Crunch cough cough sniffle step Sniffles crunches and questions were then followed by the words of the poet David Whyte By the lake in the wood in the shadows you can whisper that truth to the quiet reflection you see in the water Remember in this place no one can hear you and out of the silence you can make a promise it will kill you to break That way the poet promises youll find what is real and what is not Whats real Whats not Id walked Wonderland with my colleague Andrew just days before It was on our third circumambulation of the lake when he finally asked the question hed been carrying What should I do with my life Earlier in the week hed stopped me at a coffee shop mid order he turned to me Can we go for a walk sometime His eyes revealed a terror he expected me to scoff and reject him to laugh in his face at the absurdity of his idea Of course I said Id like that How about Friday at eleven at Wonderland Cattails at the lakes edge swayed The frost glistened as the sun moved toward the center of the sky He turns to me I know this is absurd of me to ask I mean Im a coach too and Im supposed to be giving other people advice but well The pause hung What I asked Andrew whatever story youre telling yourself is likely wrong Whatever it is thats stopping you from speaking is old tired and worn out Old programming designed to keep you safe Im not judging you Im just a friend going for a walk with you He burst into tears I dont know what to do with my life Im fortyfour years old and I have no idea if Im doing the right thing The tears flowed and his body shook I grabbed his hands and squared up opposite him Andrew no one knows if theyre doing the right thing No one Whatever story youve been telling yourself about how youve failed whatever should youve been carrying about having had it all figured out by now well all thats just bullshit stories told to you by the ghosts in your machine Through blurry teary eyes he looked from our clasped hands to my eyes still unsure if I was judging him But youve got it all together you figured out how to make a living doing the thing you love I burst out laughing Oh geez Have I got you fooled We started walking again His questions became pragmatic and structural Give me the steps Jerry How do I get customers How do I convince people to hire me How do I build a business How do I raise money How do I hire people How do I fire people All genuine important questions but really all a proxy for the deeper existential questions Am I doing it right Is it supposed to feel this confusing Will I ever feel safe warm and happy Where do I belong What do I want from this life Am I worth it Have I earned my place on the planet in this life And of course If my life isnt unfolding as I expected then what am I doing I want to strip everything away he continued Anything thats not me to the bare essence of me just so I can figure out what path I should take I knew that feeling Years before I had knelt before Pema Chdrn pleading for her to tell me the path the way the steps I should take to take me out of the pain Then she lovingly tapped my hand telling me about the pathless path It makes sense now then it left me bereft You seem to want to know that youre making progress I offered That theres a path and that youre on it He nodded with relief Its curious I continued Were all so desperate to move up and to the right Were convinced that any motion that isnt straight direct up and to the right is somehow not part of the path What if being lost is part of the path What if we are supposed to tack across the surface of the lake sailing into the wind instead of wishing it was only at our backs What if feeling lost directionless and uncertain of the progress is an indicator of growth What if it means youre exactly where you need to be on the pathless path Opening an email recently there it is again the wish for direction a path Dear Jerry the inquiry begins I am looking to define a meaningful next chapter which meets my personal professional and practical goals And then opening yet another note Im not lost but could sure do with a point in the right direction and a kick up the ass We all want it movement that demonstrates that our experience is meaningful that its taking us someplace a place where we are smarter richer healthier less afraid more secure Up up and to the right We live in a world that says anything less is failure Up and to the right were told is where the happy people are Thats where the people who never fear never fail never struggle live Our economy is driven by the sense that heredown and to the leftis awful and if we buy the right soap drive the right car build the right company love the right way well be safe and loved and happy forever and ever And ever We look to those who seem serene contentthe embodiment of up and to the rightand fail to see the struggles they have lived through We project onto them our wishes and expectations of reaching that point where all things are at peace and we never ever have bodily odor Everyone elses journey is so much easier Everyone elses business is so much more successful And if only someoneyouwould show me the steps on the path give me a map then I can get there too But a map is a poor substitute for a life lived The truest guide isnt the mind of a guru but your broken scared and scarred lonely heart I just wish brokenopen hearts werent so damned painful The irony of course is that up and to the right as appealing as it is when were down and to the left is a place of separation Its a place where were we to achieve it at all wed find ourselves utterly alone Handprints on the Canyon Wall Tucked up in clefts in the cliffs wrote the poet Gary Snyder in his poem Anasazi Anasazi and their descendants the Havasupai I hear their names as I close my eyes and dream of my days visiting the Grand Canyon By August 2001 everything was broken One of the companies Id invested in The Industry Standard magazine had been an emblem of the seeming rise and rise of the new economy Each weekly issue was fat with ads Then suddenly it all seemed to stop With the collapse of the financial markets venture capital stopped flowing to startups With start ups failing like falling knives ads dried up Suddenly caught with too many expenses management struggled to find a way to rightsize our way out of the problem Infighting fear clashes between the investors myself included kept us from funding the shortfall Suddenly we were bankrupt It was big news as most of the people who followed the venturebacked technology space also read The Industry Standard In August 2001 as the news broke I was hiking down the Kaibab Trail from the North Rim of the Grand Canyon with a group that would spend the next week rafting the Colorado at the base of the canyon in the belly of the Earth The first stirrings of the unease discomfort and pain thatmonths later would leave me gasping for air for life at Ground Zero had begun just after the market freefall in March 2001 Shortly after Fred my partner at Flatiron and I had begun negotiating with our investors about altering or even shutting down the investment program wed launched in 1996 I remember tearfully telling Fred that I wasnt sure what was happening to me or what I wanted to do long term but I knew I couldnt commit to building another investment fund I didnt know it but I was dying inside Back in the canyon I began to both fall apart and sense that there was another way Three days into the rafting trip all the stresses of life above the rim had slipped away Id lie on my sleeping pad at night relaxing my gaze to better glimpse shooting stars Id discovered that looking for the movement was not the way to see theman insight that I have come back to time and again in the years since The night before we were to visit Deer Creek Canyona sacred place where the Havasupai youth would test their adulthood by leaping across a chasm to leave a handprint on the other sideI felt the thinness of my own existence I realized as poet David Whyte notes how easily the thread is broken between this world and the next Handprints on the canyon wall placed as those young warriors entered the temple of their adult aloneness testified that regardless of the solitude they had been there I lay in the dark as the dawn broke past the rim weeping What are my handprints I yelled at myself Some fucking investment Is this how my passage through and existence in this life is gonna be remembered Fuck I thought back to the time when sheltered under the boardwalk at Coney Island I declared This is not going to be my life I wasnt meant to live hidden in the shadows of the boardwalk weeping Suddenly amid the tears I had a memory I remembered walking out of a movie theater with my big sister Mary Shed taken the sevenyearold me to the Loews Kings Theatre on Flatbush Avenue blocks from our home on East 26th Streetbetween Clarendon Road and Avenue Dto see a Laurel and Hardy film festival A weird kid I loved Laurel and Hardy and Mary loved me and so she wanted me to be happy and took me to see sixtyyear old films For hours wed sat in the darkened Kings Afterward holding hands swinging arms we walked to the ice cream parlor movies and ice cream and swinging arms love safety and belonging What do you want to be when you grow up Jerry she asked Looking back I realize she was a kid herself just in her twenties and was already the teacher shed chosen as her profession I dont know I answered shyly unsure of what she was really asking me Pausing before speaking more I remembered the feeling I often had before falling asleep each night As I lay in bed a dark hole in my chest would open up a hollowness a loneliness deeper than anything that stemmed merely from being alone To close the hole Id hug my Howdy Doody doll ever closer It was a toy it was supposed to be played with in a particular way A kid was supposed to use it to put on puppet shows But not me I just hugged him held him and used him as best as the sevenyearold me could to close that gaping wound that crack in the bark of my tree After becoming a father I came to realize that not everyone felt that hole in the chest not everyone saw the hole as evidence of brokenness and unlovability Still hesitating I turned to Mary I think I think maybe I dont want to be forgotten We stopped walking and she turned to see me more clearly inviting me to say more Like I dont know a hundred years from now when someone is talking about Flatbush Avenue and the Kings and the people who lived here I want people to know I was here Seen but not seen There but not there The boy in the crack of the tree wishing to leave handprints Decades later I stared at the handprints on the walls of the canyon deep in the belly of the Grand Canyon I had fallen apart just as Pema in a way predicted when she had written her book I looked for my own handprints evidence that I had passed this way that I mattered Then at the bottom of the canyon I found a new way to see At the end of the rafting trip we were lifted from the bottom of the canyon by helicopter Two hours later I sat at McCarran Airport stunned by the incessant ding ding ding of slot machines cascading coins and dreams of a better life Id left the canyon but the canyon never left me After Ground Zero Once upon a time there was a prince who stood not under a boardwalk in Brooklyn but within a castle in northern India declaring in his way that this was not to be his life He left his fathers castle to find himself and ended up under the bodhi tree Having declared Fuck it hed given up trying to see the shooting stars and learned to relax his gaze We came out of the canyon and into September 11 2001 and its aftershocks I had naively thought that market collapses vanishing wealth and failing falling knives of startup investments were bad But I hadnt considered the unrelenting terror emanating from Ground Zero How could I have The springtime collapse of 2001 the lateAugust handprints on canyon walls the autumnal dying of the light and terrifying rupture of our collective delusions of safety all led inexorably to my collapse They all led too to my transformation and an acceptance of my purpose my karma and my reason for being It was as if shooting stars asteroids and meteors had fallen from the sky hitting me midway through the journey of my life and knocking me not merely onto a new trajectory but into the orbit I was born to traverse Looking backward I couldnt draw a straight upandtotheright line defining my path no matter how hard I tried Understanding that this is in fact the universal pathless path defies not only the messages of our economy It defies the daily and relentless propaganda of social media My friends and family especially those in their twenties confound themselves not only by holding themselves to some unrealistic standard of a nonmessy straightforward unfolding of their lives but by comparing their internal mass of contradictions confusion and uncertainty with the happy lives they see posted on Instagram I say this dramatically trying to cut through the fog of useless and constant comparison in which we inevitably come up short less than and therefore broken and unworthy of love Dear ones Newsflash Snapchat Instagram and Facebook lie The path to a purposegrounded life is messy muddy rockstrewn and slippery I have a dear friend a bootcamper who knew all her life that she liked girls more than she liked boys But in the Christian household of her childhood her truest self was quashed because she was believed to be possessed I have another dear friend another bootcamper who knew her whole life that the gender assigned to her by the world was wrong Misgendered Not her She was trapped in a jail made of the bars of others perceptions All her life she played along to try to belong and playing along she felt she was slowly dying inside One night under the stars of a clear Colorado night she heard stories of others whose truths were quashed squashed and squeezed to fit into someone elses preconception of what it meant to be a CEO an entrepreneur a good girl a good boy worthy of love safety and belonging She felt their tears She leaped across the chasm the false chasm the one that tells us that the Others story is not our story and that our story is uniquely bad or differentfurther evidence not of our adult aloneness but of our childlike fearful loneliness The cause of the deep chasm in the middle of our chest In that leap she touched the handprints of the others whod leaped their own chasms and in so doing she was able to leave her own Leaving too the old identity unlearning all that had confined her all that restricted her all that entrapped her She discovered who she is now casting aside the need to know who she will be later She dared to leave new truer handprints on the walls of the newest canyon of her life The path requires standing still radically inquiring within learning to the bear the pain of uncertainty Discovering your purpose feeling your way into that aliveness requires clambering up rocky cliff faces leaping chasms tucking oneself deep into clefts and deeper and deeper into the Earth It demands the willingness to step into the crack of the tree as well as the bravery to step out of it All this and goodsoled hiking boots But I Need a Plan Crunch crunch step My goodsoled lowcut hiking boots slipped and slid as Andrew and I made kora rimming Wonderland But youve got it all together you figured out how to make a living doing the thing you love I chuckled quietly knowing what was coming next I need a plan Heres your plan I said out loud annoyingly enigmatically stop looking for shooting stars I told him about lying on banks of the Colorado River learning to relax my gaze What would it feel like to let go of the need to know I asked He paused and felt what it would feel like in his body not in his mind if he let go of not only the need to progress but of the belief in progress What would it feel like in that body of yours I continued if incremental progress that was directionally correct were enough What would it feel like to tack across the surface of that lake instead of heading out for the other side fully intending to make it in the shortest time possible I could sense him turning inward and really considering the feeling Crunch crunch We walked on in silence and then he broke it Relaxed I smiled enigmatically and lovingly If you could give up the need for measurable progress if you give up the pursuit of purpose and meaning I continued adding quietly to myselfand the need to build an exhaustible supply of lemon dropsand then focused on doing what is right and true each day it feels to me that youd live in congruency with your truest self where the meaning of your life was a function of the meaning of each day And each day an expression of your life Early in 2017 I dreamed I was back in Tibet hiking in a valley outside the city of Yushu Id first visited Yushu in September 2010 five months after an earthquake had killed thousands of people and destroyed hundreds of buildings Wed spent months raising money and wed brought supplies winter tents thick blankets waterto a community still struggling to recover In the dream I was wearing lowcut hiking boots clambering among the rocky terrain of a valley pockmarked with carved images of Tibetan Buddhist saints and the ubiquitous prayer in Tibetan script Om Mani Padme Hum In the dream I sat down to take a drink when a hole opened in the ground between my bent knees Peering into the hole I realized that it was a mine shaft and that it was endlessly deep Lungtatiny Tibetan wind horse prayer flags normally tossed at high mountain passes so that the winds can carry the prayers printed on them to the Buddhas of the past present and futurefluttered in the shaft Peering deep I saw the Lungta turn into pages of the book of my life Scared little boy Struggling adolescent lost questioning whether to go to school or even to live English major studying poetry with and starstruck by Marie Ponsot Scholarship winner and suddenly struck by a shooting star and set on a new course a reporter at a technology magazine Finding myself as my life unfolded yet still haunted by the sense of being lost My twenties became my thirties My thirties seemed successful I began collecting lemon drops Then suddenly struck by another shooting star weeping in the canyon falling to my knees at Ground Zero discovering compassion and the nature of reality through Pema Chdrns eyes discovering courage through Parker Palmers writing and discovering faith and lovingkindness through the words of Sharon Salzberg Still lost still searching still struggling to let go of the need for progress that was more than directionally correct looking for the upandtotheright path I left my career Looking for the wellworn easytotravel path the one where your shoes didnt need to be especially grippy I crossed the polar ice cap in Greenland rafted the Futaleuf River in Chile and most important learned to meditate to stand still even in empty time I told Andrew My path was anything but straight What if we lived our lives forgetting the destination were aiming for I asked What if we woke each day and just wondered what will happen today As we continued walking I was reminded of Joseph Campbells thought that the pursuit of purpose and meaning is really a pursuit of aliveness of rapture Andrew leaned in his eyes flashed And aliveness well I dont know how we are fully alive when we spend all this energy damping down and rejecting the various parts of ourselves Dear Professor Campbell yes indeed the pursuit of purpose is really a cover for the pursuit of a feeling aliveness But aliveness can come about only after integrating even the most shameful parts of ourselveseven the stories of our misdeeds mistakes and missteps Integrating those and learning to forgive oneself Theres something you need to know about me I told him Im a sucker for Oreos In the years before during and immediately after my Ground Zero days I was seventyfive pounds heavier than I am today Frustrated angry disgusted with myself I hauled my fat ass into a nutritionists office Erica gave me a lot of tools I continued including a whole new approach to food But the most important gift she gave me was the power of doovers I explained that one day I had come to see her dejected and ready to give up I whined I ate a fucking dozen Oreos last night Erica a fucking dozen Well the combination of sugar and salt is deadly for you Some folks like sweets Some like salts Youre one of the lucky few she said with sweet sarcasm who craves both An Oreo is the perfect drug for you And then she gave me the gift Tonight its a doover Start again And suddenly I was twelve and back in Brooklyn this time on West 7th Street and Avenue T playing stickball with Paulie Ugo and Pino And we were arguing about whether Paulies shot was a hit or a foul and to stop the fighting Ugo yells Doover and just like that all is forgiven all is forgotten Its not an out Its not a foul Its not a hit Doover Latermuch laterI read Shunry Suzukis Zen Mind Beginners Mind and realized that coming back to the beginners mind is a doover If I allow myself I tell Andrew then I can have an infinite number of do overs I explained that we can always return to what is what is really happening what is truly present Even more powerfully if we do that then we can let go of the email let go of the missed quarter let go of the shame of having eaten all those Oreos Endless Doovers If you allow it each footstep can be a doover I was speaking by satellite phone with my client and friend the polar explorer Ben Saunders as he was trying to retrace his friend Henry Worsleys path across Antarctica The sastrugithe parallel wavelike ridges carved by the polar winds into the surface of icy snowwere tougher than hed imagined and he was close to giving up The possibility of giving up wears on him In 2016 his friend his mentor Henry stopped one hundred and twentysix miles short of his goal of being the first person to cross the Antarctic peninsula unaided and unassisted Overcome by exhaustion and airlifted out Henry died in Chile Bens trying to complete the journey to finish his friends quest Hes been cursing each ridge he told me each ridge means he cant really ski but must painfully step up and over Soften your gaze I told him Each morning each step is a chance for beginners mind I continued Id recommended Shunry Suzuki as a companion on this trip so he understood the reference Perhaps you can hold off deciding to continue or not until you make it to the Pole When the big goal feels too large take only small steps I thought of my advice to Ben as I listened to Hollis my editor Midway through the journey of this book every page every word felt like a sastruga ridge with fiftybelow headwinds pushing me back Just write essays she counseled The next week I reread Anne Lamotts Bird by Bird She tells the story of her father helping her brother write a school essay on birds Bird by bird buddy Just take it bird by bird Do you remember those old manuals IBM used to put out with their software Im sitting by a fire at a retreat center with my longtime friend the wonderful author Seth Godin and hes giving me advice on how to keep going when you want to give up When youre stuck you should just do what they did stick a blank page in the stuck point and type This Page Left Intentionally Blank Bird by bird Blank page by blank page Ridge by ridge Step by step And if need be doover after doover after doovertacking across the surface of the lake of your life of the book youve promised to write the friends journey youve promised to complete making incremental progress thats directionally correct Asteroid Strikes and Strategic Retreats So we move across the lake this way and that We launch a business and we think Ah Im in the search business and suddenly some tool we created to make our business run more smoothly is seen by a customer who says Wait I dont want your product I want that And you shift your business is different Or sometimes in moving across the lake you major in English in college and finally youve got an answer to the question your sister asked you on Flatbush Avenue all those years later Im going to be a teacher like you But then suddenly youre in your advisers office crying about the fact that you dont have the money for tuition and that you must drop out and Professor Robert Greenberg says Well thats not going to happen Youre not dropping out Im the judge of a scholarship contest and Im going to give you the scholarship Itll pay your tuition until you finish up An asteroid strikeyou can stay in school and then you tack in a completely different direction because the scholarship comes with a summer internship A few months later youre spending your summer proofreading copy at a weekly technology magazine and unbeknownst to you youve stumbled into a career that will eventually lead to a position as an investor in technology companies and still later as a coach talking with folks about their own twisty topsyturvy lives Like the awardwinning filmmaker and entrepreneur Jeff Orlowski You leave high school thinking youre going to be a professional photographer a professional cyclist or a professional pianistcertainly not an engineer as your mother wanted So yes you agree to go to Stanford and then one day you see a notice that a climate scientist needs an assistant to help take pictures and as a websavvy teenager youre using your skills to launch a business that builds websites for photographers like your father And through that connection you find out that a climate scientist needs a website built and hey you know how to do that so you offer to do some free work and months later youre in Greenland setting up cameras to photograph And years later your new friends have made a film that picks up awards at festivals around the world and you find yourself onstage with close friends accepting an Emmy And suddenly youre a filmmaker Whats more youre an entrepreneur raising money making productart to change the world Um so I went to a camp Jeff told me I went to a camp when I was in high school called Camp Rising Sun Its this youth leadership program in upstate New York It had a profound impact on me for for countless reasons And he tells me a story about the campfires held every Saturday night Teenagers youth leaders all sitting around the fire thinking What shall I do with my life Some think Professional cyclist photographer or pianist Others are even less sure The elders in the community would share some insights some wisdom he continued There was one that a friend of mine a mentor gave that has stuck with me for a really really long time The mentor Chris was a skilled chess player and hed drawn some analogies between chess and life He shared this concept of a strategic retreat There are times both in chess and in life when youre going down a certain path and you hit a roadblock And then you realize that the moves youre trying to make arent working out At those times I have to abandon that game plan and restrategize and make a strategic retreat and take a different plan of attack I pointed out that the retreat is strategic because its smart it keeps you safe and it comes from a place of being brave enough to admit that you need to choose differently That the path isnt straight and up and to the right We cant plan for an asteroid strike As I learned lying on the banks of the Colorado at the bottom of the canyon the best we can do is relax our gaze and let the shooting stars streak across our life What Stops You from Having the Life You Deserve Im racing to make a flight when my cell phone vibrates Fuck Whos calling now I look down at the LCD presmartphone screenthis is 1996 its Mark Pincus Fuck Mark is calling me again Months before Id met Mark and his partner Sunil Paul when they were raising money for their first startup Freeloader Sunil and I had known each other from my days at CMP and we continued to stay in touch after I left CMP and helped start CMGVentures a tinyventure fund that was part of a public company called CMG Inc CMGI Mark knew an investor Fred Wilson then with a venture firm called Euclid Partners Fred invested in Freeloader I couldnt get the deal past my partners Even though I was not an investor I continued to respond to Marks requests for help Jerry hed email what do you think of this revenue model I delighted in Mark despite his relentlessness Racing to board my flight I choose to answer my phone Bam another asteroid strikes My path suddenly altered and here is a new unexpected way forward Freds raising a new fund Mark blurts out and you should be his partner Six months or so later wed launched Flatiron Partners What if I hadnt taken his call What if I had simply followed my initial selfish impulses and ignored Marks insistent incessant requests for help Dammit Im not even an investor I have nothing to gain from helping you What if I hadnt walked into Professor Greenbergs office and admitted that Id been ignoring the letters from the bursars office Since then Ive passed through the Flatiron days Ive floated down the Colorado River lived through the crazymaking experiences of sudden wealth syndrome and shameproducing consequences of businesses Ive invested in failing and years later Ive emerged scarred but steady Alive and thriving Im on my own working as a coach Freds still a close friend as is Brad Feld another loving asteroid in my life whom I first met in the early days of my career back when we all had thick black hair and laughing enthusiasm for the sheer fun of building a new world out of this thing called the Internet Both Fred and Brad love me and are generous and kind in singing my praises I can take in some of their love and yet I know too that its coming through the filter of decades of friendship One day an email arrives I was reading a blog post by Fred Wilson wrote Khalid Halim In the post hed written that I was the best CEO coach he knew Khalid explained that he wanted to be a coach and wondered if I would be willing to help him At that point I was overwhelmed I dont have time for another client I said to myself petulantly My old old old sense of too many people wanting too much from me rises Yet the sincerity of his wish stops me and I read his note again and again He wants to help others I see I think I see his heart I say yes to an earlySaturdaymorning call every few weeks And yet today hes one of my partners in this heartfilled enterprise where we take closed scared and scarred leaders and help their hearts break open and for warriors to emerge Theres Khalid with whom I partnered to form Reboot Theres Dan Putt another former client turned partner and cofounder whose strength and gentleness were clear to me even as they were shielded from him shielded by the confusion of his selfdoubt and his rigidly held belief that there was a path to entrepreneurial freedom nirvana and life everlasting His own capacity was blocked by the firmly held belief that the reason he couldnt see the path clearly was that he was broken Not that the path is pathless but that he wasnt worthy to trod it And Ali Schultz our fourth cofounder herself an asteroid with a sparkly smile and fierce heart who challenged me to step into my own capacity with her own simple question on a walk in the hills surrounding Boulder What stops you from building the life you really deserve What if I hadnt answered that email from Khalid The request for coaching from Dan Or the invitation from Ali to hike What if I hadnt put Dan together with Khalid together with Ali and all three challenged the four of us to take the next step and build a company out of the singular lives wed crafted for ourselves One day long after having given up his dream of being a writerthe unspoken unacknowledged answer to his sister Marys question of what hed like to be when he grew up the unvoiced plan behind his wish to be rememberedthe English major turned tech reporter turned venture capitalist turned brokenhearted coach got an email from a prestigious editor from a prestigious publisher Have you ever considered writing a book One day I had the courage to answer an email that would have me writing a chapter on the life transformations of asteroid strikes and how purpose is lived into and not merely found Sometimes the paralysis of choice stems not from the path being winding unpredictable and uncertain but from the forks in the road Implicit in the belief that the path is not in fact pathless is the belief that theres a wrong fork and worse we may choose unwisely only to regret our lives Its hard enough to fend off the fear of choosing unwisely Its hard enough to try to relax your gaze enough to know that life will unfold however it will unfold and somehow just be okay with that Harder still is the burden of disappointing those who wish us to step off onto one fork or the other Sage Joseph Campbell with love and joy suggested we follow our bliss But when facing that fork in the road when at the crossroad choosing to tack left or right we want so much to know which path will lead to bliss If we knew which path the right path was crossroads wouldnt be as mystical or magical as they are Look for the turtles I said one day to thenclient Dan Putt while he sat on my couch wondering which fork to take Look for the turtles I said thinking it made me sound like a wise old soul Look for the turtles I said recalling the joyfilled instructions his late mother would share with him as they would wander for a walk at a nearby pond during the latter stages of her battle with breast cancer How do you look for the turtles when youre unsure which path the turtles are taking How do you even know where to look for the turtles That is this lifes work because that is the work of our lives Like Dan and so many others like me sitting on the couch listening to Ani Pema speak of the pathless path we often suffer because we are convinced that the path to fulfillment and a life of purpose is out there to be discovered found Once found or pointed to by some wise sage our taskwe believe is to head out unflinchingly striding with cleareyed resolve We come of age asking ourselves Who am I to be Later as we live our way into being who we are we come to questions What am I to do and What is my purpose Later still as our elderwisdom seeps into our bones we might replace that question with the simple Have I been kind Am I the adult I was supposed to be when under the boardwalk I shook my fist at the sky and declared that this was not to be my life Is this the life of meaning that is my birthright Theres a devilish trap though in that question A trap exacerbated by the admonitions and advice of writers ascetics sages and charlatans who overtly or covertly offer steps on the path The trap is implicit in the question Purpose is not something external to us Its not a place to get to The admonitions instructions and advice of others will at best fall short and at worst make one feel nothing but harshly selfcritical for even holding the question in the first place The wise teacher Joseph Campbell wrote that people conflate the pursuit of purpose with a pursuit of aliveness Ill go further though aliveness comes not from having magically discovered purpose meaning nirvana and a neverending supply of lemon drops Aliveness comes from living a life of personal integrity in which our outer actions match our inner values beliefs wishes and dreams I am living my purpose living with aliveness when I write regardless of whether my words are published This then defines our lifes work not as a path to be discovered and certainly not by following someone elses map but as a way of being where each day is a chance to live into the command to live with the inner and outer in alignment Acknowledging the days weeks months and years when we have not lived that way giving ourselves the doover the freshness of beginners mind to rise again and try again Workour careers our professions our jobsis neither the blissful expression of deep purpose nor the dreadful obligation that stands in the way of being ourselves Work is an opportunity for a daily realignment of the inner and outer a daily doover of life expressed with integrity Transformation is not how we discover the path up and to the right No matter how many trips around Wonderland Lake we take we are still bound to the truest task live into congruency tacking across the lake where the winds powering us are the answers to the questions Who are we What do we believe to be true today What is the world we wish to create every day with our actions and our hearts This calling to a deep radical inquiry into self is not only the path of transformation the path to purpose but in the end how we grow strong resilient and capable of meeting the world like the openhearted warriors we were born to be By this process of withstanding the asteroid strikes of people of loss of confusion we fill the holes in our chests not with marionettes cars or even money but with our own souls We turn the wounds of every day into sacred and healing balms for others and for ourselves We must therefore remain open to those asteroids and the smart strategic retreats Standing still leaning in and listening to our children our partners our loves our employees our customers and most important our own hearts that is how we grow Walking the forests canyons and trails of life I marvel at split boulders How does something so substantive so strong split in half The boulder splits because over eons drip by drip water carves out first an indentation then a divot then a depression until a pool forms turns to ice expands and splits the rock We are the rock Our splits occur after the drip drip drip becomes a pool and the cold freezes the water creating pressure strong enough to break us open This is how we grow We integrate the asteroid strikes the twists and turns of forks in the road The pain of uncertainty missteps strategic retreats the echoing voices in our heads that caution us to choose wisely Then suddenly the rock splits air rushes in the next few steps on a path become clear and we stride forward Although we are unsure of what it will all lead to everything nevertheless becomes purposeful Everything becomes sacred when good work is done well for the right reasons The drama of being human is great and complicated The pathless path is pockmarked with pain and suffering But seen from the vantage point that all steps are purposeful all of it becomes worthwhilea glorious life giving retort to those who would question our worthiness and lovability Journaling Invitations Whats my purpose Why do I feel lost while I struggle to move forward How do I grow transform and build a life of meaning Chapter 7 Loving the Crow It took years but I finally learned to love the whole of me and become a warrior Its been quite a journey As a teenager I found something romantic and noble about the writer who throws his manuscript into the fireplace or the painter who in a fit of selfloathing slashes her finished work with a razor In my thirties I began to map out the web that links my most critical inner voices and perversely my persistent wishes for love safety and belonging Moreover I began to see how each of our inner loves conflicts and lives is projected into the world through our relationships our companies and our work Only now in my fifties have I begun to realize that those critical voicesthe ones whispering that we are no good less than a fakeare ironically meant to soothe us and keep us safe The voice of the inner critic is meant to protect us from humiliation and shame from the risks of being found outfrom being seen as the impostor the charlatan we fear we may beor think we already know we are Hating the Life Weve Created I hate the fucking product said Maria my client She has curled her body into the corner of the pale blue couch in my office hugging one of the two burntorange pillows the one with a small black ink stain I stared at the stain and my mind drifted to movies and books filled with scenes of the angstridden artist I wake grab the app and feel sick she continued I want to tear everything apart and start all over I know that pain I reminded myself that existential lacerations can feel more painful than bodily pain When I was the editor of InformationWeek magazine we worked for months on a redesign we had hourslong conversations about every meticulous detail We debated font size picas and kerning We compared color scheme after color scheme When we were done I felt a rush of pride as the first copies came back from the printer A month later I hated everything about that damn new design Why do we hate what we labor so long to create Its partly because neither the song we hear in our head nor the application we dream up late at night as we cant sleep nor the story we write in the car as we drive home nor the company we quit our safe job to found is ever the same as the song thats eventually sung It pains me when I see my clients artists every one of them frustrated that no one can hear the notes as well as they can I think of Drew whos burned through CTO after CTO firing one after another Make it like this I imagine him saying as he races across the whiteboard making everyone slightly nauseated with the fumes of the markers Then it should do this then this and then this Make the users feel this way and then that or that And inevitably they blurt out No no no NOT that grabbing the dryerase marker like this I see the product manager shake his head and the engineer slinking back to her desk muttering to each other What the hell does he want now Sometimes our frustration grows out of boredomfamiliarity breeding contempt We live with our creations day in day out and come to hate them Seeing only the flaws in the creation were simply painfully facing our deepest insecurities our deepest doubts about our right to create anything at all Most important though the frustration is egged on by a whispery persistent critical voice asking Who the hell do you think you are as if you could cause this impossible glorious song to come into being Why would anyone want to use something you created Youre just wrong Everyone knows youve no idea what youre doing I feel it most acutely when I write Some days I hate every single syllable I type I even hate that sentence This one too I took a few writing courses in college One professor the brilliant poet Marie Ponsot would talk about the Crow sitting on your shoulder saying things like That sucks How could you write that and Are you kidding me Diminutive chainsmoking Marie would raise her tobacco stained fingers into the air punctuating every word Shoot The Damn Crow Each time our work fails to live up to our whispered expectations or those grumblings we convince ourselves might be held against us by our employees our investors our colleagues and our loved ones were reminded of one of our most complicated and intricate fearful belief systems We will inevitably fail because we are a fraud and such failure will prove once and for all what we suspected all alongthat we are unworthy of love do not belong anywhere and are therefore wholly unsafe These everyday failures become evidence that we are not only unsafe but undeserving of even wishing for safety at all The Crow after cawing into our ear about our failure and our fraudulent true self hops to the other shoulder cawing that we never belonged at all The vulnerable child in each of us gets caught between the urge to be himself and the fear that doing so will bring shame and humiliation The temptation to stay unseen and thus safe is strong Cawcawcaw If you succeed in being your own self and bringing forth your own creations you run the risk of humiliating rejection The cawing admonishes Dont create dont express who you are truly The pain of hating our own creation is a consequence of our investing too much of our sense of being into the company the product the creation When we hang our sense of self on the whisper of an idea when we unwittingly insist that our love safety and belonging depend on what we do and most important how others feel about our feelings our actions and our work then we leave little space for anything other than bitter existential suffering Life in the Shadow As Carl Jung notes Until you make the unconscious conscious it will direct your life and you will call it fate Jung goes on to assert that humans place the positive and negative attributes of our characterour feelings beliefs the things we typically define as strengths and weaknesses anything that conflicts with our sense of who and what we are supposed to beinto our personal shadow This allegorical shadow operates the way our true shadow doesbehind us just out of our direct sight where we have but the vaguest awareness of its existence We glimpse it only by craning our necks Collectively those qualities and aspects that are incompatible with our sense of who we need to be to be loved and to belong get rejected disowned and placed in an unlit unseen part of our consciousness forever denied and angrily anxiously guiltily defended against These attributes continue to exist marinating in our lived experiences brewing into a cocktail potent enough to knock us and those we cherish onto our asses In being denied these attributes grow in intensity periodically explosively often tragically these attributes step out of the shadow and into the scenes of our lives in troubling and troublesome ways Theres the leader whose childhood was marked by poverty and deprivation and in a bid to feel safe nurses ambition and desperate cravings to prove all the doubters wrong But given the strictures of their childhood or family structures given the risk of expulsion from the only tribe they may ever have known they bury that ambition labeling the wish for money as greed and placing it out of sight in their shadow over their shoulder into what the poet Robert Bly dubbed the long black bag we drag behind us Or the CEO whose brilliant ways threatened her standing in middle school and so more than merely denying her intellect she actively rejects any challenging books or squirms in a classroom seat lest her light be revealed her artistry manifested and her place in the family threatened Unconsciously she internalizes the isolation caused by the middleschool bullies remaining cut off from potential allies and isolated from colleagues All of itall the positive all the negative aspects of our character that make us stand out be differentis thrown into that long black bag Just as shooting stars are best glimpsed peripherally we must rely on others to help us see how our disowned positive and negative attributes are determining our conscious lives Recently I sat in my current therapists office his chair across from mine lamenting again about the unfair and inexplicable aspects of my life Again and again I lay out in fine detail all the ways Ive been wronged At such times my rage drives an intense plotting and scheming I think about the moves and countermoves Id make in the battle with that other person Do you see it my therapist asks Do you see that the more you plot the cleverer you feel And the cleverer you feel the more hooked on the anger you become You nurse and feed that anger until youre operating purely out of your shadow I look up startled ashamed feeling caught with my true feelingsmy angerrevealed My ohsoclever facade of brilliant plotting and analysis was laid bare Theres only one way we can know if our disowned selves are calling the shots We must take the radical step of inquiring into our selves seeking to see ourselves with clarity grace compassion and a fierce commitment to cut through our own bullshit We open ourselves up to ways weve been complicit in creating the conditions we say we dont want We check for example the patterns of our lives Why do we always hire greedy salespeople Why do we always find ourselves feeling annihilated by and subordinate to those with more structural power And more telling when does our typical pattern of equanimity get so quickly and readily disturbed Despite having worked so hard to learn the quality and beauty of standing still why do I still lie awake at night again and again nursing the same old injuries and perceived slights Clients friends and Ieach of us all of uscan lament Fuck my life Why does this always happen to me Worse still because our denied attributes live just outside our daily view our conscious mind is convinced the consequences of that denial of self must come from some outside force It is not my denial of the totality of who I am that causes me distress its always the Irrational Other The key to understanding is noticing the reaction Dr Sayres my once longtime therapist would say If its hysterical its historical If theres an outsized reactionnegative or positivechances are youre operating from your shadow Or even more precisely grabbing an attribute out of the long black bag and flinging it onto the people in your life and blaming them for your internal discontent Of course it takes some skill to unpack the black bag Were remarkably skilled at dodging and weaving protecting the unseen things from the light of day When a client begins to unpack such patterns the Crow will flap his wings cock his head and turn his jetblack eye toward a juicy bit of self revelation and twist it into further selfcriticism See hell croak into my clients ear We knew you were essentially a shit One of the Crows many trickster defenses is to see the radical self inquiry process as an inquisition Seeing the look in their eye recognizing the audible gulp that signals a recognition Ill joke about the ways in which we all do this This isnt evidence of your unlovability Ill interject disrupting the inquiryintoinquisition process Its evidence of your humanity More important I explain its proof that you learned the most important skill any human needs survival The Loyal Soldier and Surviving into Adulthood I first read of the Loyal Soldier on my way back from Greenland Ive never been sure why I went to Greenland in the first place It was during my post JPMorgan years my years of learning to sit learning to listen to my own heart so perhaps that process led to a restlessness and a desire to feel the Earth more viscerally I went with an adventurous plan spend two weeks on a peninsula on the East Coast experience life in a polar region Skiing and trekking 200 kilometers and camping every night or whatever there was of night at that latitude in April The first night we pitched our tent on thousandyearold ice more than a mile thick The sun was bright even though it was ten oclock Wed traveled for more than five hours by snowmobile from a tiny airstrip near Scoresby Sund a fjord system on the southeastern corner of Greenland We crawled into our tents excited and tired Hours passed A dusky night sky replaced the brightasday light I lay in my sleeping bag wrapped in my down jacket pants booties and more clothes than Id ever worn at one time before I stared at a thermometer hanging from the top of the tents interior I watched the tiny sliver of mercury drop from a warm twenty degrees Fahrenheit to well below zero Within days Id had a bad fall busted up my hip and far sooner than I expected I was back on a plane first to Iceland and then home It was on that trip home that I read depth psychologist Bill Plotkins Soulcraft and recognized my Loyal Soldier whod dedicated his life to saving me from being cast out keeping me safe and making me feel loved The image is poignantly simple A lone soldier cut off from the rest of his comrades defending an isolated rock of an island armed with just an old rifle The soldiers have had no contact with the outside world for months for years They have eaten only elk as the poet Robert Bly would write avoided elevators and made up their minds to save you from death Alone cut off convinced that the war they signed up to fight is still raging at home they swear to defend this rock this piece of the homeland by oiling their rifle keeping up their routines and drilling themselves in the rules that will keep you safe These include rules such as this Stay small Dont stand out Careful now Dont make mistakes The rules these Loyal Survival Strategies show up throughout our lives morphing and weaving into each other For one person it may be the admonition to always put others before oneself Thats a problem of course when such movement isnt rooted in a healthy lifegiving altruism but stems instead from the belief that anything but the total negation of the self risks incurring the wrath of those around usthose charged with keeping us well and whole For another though it might be to always put yourself first lest youll be left with nothing but scraps from the family dinner At our boot camps when we talk of the Loyal Soldier a hush tends to fall over the group as the campers slowly recognize aspects of their own lives their ways of being Tears begin to flow when they realize that these aspects were necessary for their love safety and belongingtheir very survival One camper comes to recognize that his codependent caretaking and incessant need to save and fixbehavior so rewarded on his path to leadershipmay be rooted in a childhood fixation that if he were to advance his own wishes his mother would make good on her persistent threats to leave Another may come to see that being a perky people person is an inauthentic effort but nevertheless admirable and honorable to contain Dads rage and the threat of violence For some the strategies may lie behind the need to avoid conflict Or for another the belief that being alone alone with ones thoughts is dangerous Dont look there I imagine hearing a soldier warn my client Let sleeping dogs lie Each time I glimpse a survival strategy I hear the slide click slam of a bolt action rifle as if the Loyal Soldier were readying her weapon looking across the sea toward home and saying Dont worry Ive got this Ill keep you loved safe and right where you belong For many that place where weve come to think we belong has become stultifying its where we are small unseen unsure and unwilling to claim our strengths our capacities our courage our leadership We are frozen by the belief that its just too dangerous to reach into the black bag and grab hold of the disowned dismembered parts of ourselves All Loyal Soldiers then have one basic task to keep us safe from the wars that raged in our childhood No matter how awful these strategies have come to make us feel as adults they were brilliant in their own ways I know that to be true because I see you I see that you are here that you are despite feeling broken and inadequate an adult whos fully capable of loving and being loved of being safe and keeping others safe and belonging You survived Youve grown into an adult capable of grasping the ways these successful survival strategies outlived their usefulness Your Loyal Soldiers did a fine job They just dont know the war is over While the Crow may pester us he loves us and wants to keep us safe from the pain of humiliation And for these reasons I welcome home my beautiful proud vigilant Loyal Soldiers and thank my Crow for the gifts hes placed at my feet The Gifts from the Crow The flight from Reykjavik to New York crossed Newfoundland my hip hurt and I was relieved to be headed home Glimpsing the landmass of North America I thought of the Vikings Ill bet its easier to get to North America now than it was back then As I stared out the jets window my mind wandered from random thoughts of Vikings to icy lands called green and green lands called ice My Crow then woke up and went to work Why did you leave the expedition early You could have made it all the way to the end So your hip got hurt Whats wrong with you You always do this you always start something but never finish it Staring at the blackness of the North Atlantic trying to catch glimpses of icebergs tears welled up as I listened to my Crow What is wrong with you You know if Ive told you once Ive told you a million times youre not the man people think you are Youre not the man you pretend to be Sitting on the plane making my way back to my life my family in pain the best my mind could muster was additional harsh selfcriticism A decade later I see how the selfcriticism of the Crow and the defensiveness of the Loyal Soldier have been essential helping me survive my life I see them as gifts but not ones that cant be put down and left behind Harsh selfcriticism Check I live with daily questions as to whether Im a good enough man father life and business partner and leader Indeed listening to my own heart more closely I hear the fiveyearold in me making sense of the world Were I to be enougha good enough man parent leaderthen I might not belong to a family in which the parents daily expressed their brokenhearted pain through mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and alcoholism The selfcriticism can be expressed in many ways but the most dominant seems to be a lacerating guilt as my Buddhist teacher Sharon Salzberg describes it With the guilt is a terror that comes from believing not merely that Im unworthy but in fact have committed terrible terrible sins Indeed if I stopped worrying about this if I let down my hypervigilant guard long enough to feel that I were enough then I might abandon my brokenhearted parents leaving them bereft By leaving open the question of my worthiness the Crow enables me to remain my parents son From that one essential question Am I worthy enough flows a host of other strategies each designed to keep me safe Codependent caretaking for example whereby I struggle nobly silently passiveaggressively relating to others in the vain wish that they would give me what I would want Id send flowers when what I wanted was to receive them Or a pleasing personain my case the happy allknowing Buddhist who secretly is capable of mowing down any who oppose him sometimes with angry brute force but more often with a stealthy stiletto As I grew into adulthood I used my vigilance to read a room As a reporter I used this sensitivity to persuade interviewees to reveal things that no one else could get them to reveal As an investor I relied on these gifts to grok the entrepreneurs deepest motivations and understand intuitively the best ways to partner with them Years later as a coach I use my Crows gifts to help my clients listen to their own hearts Indeed every survival strategyevery whispered warning from our ever onguard Loyal Soldiers and the Crows of our lives carry remarkable gifts My need to please for example became a lifeaffirming lifegiving dedication to being of genuine service to others Similarly my need to be seen as calm calming mature and capable became a lasting skill with which I can be in fact capable and competent and a calming influence even during a raging storm The need to be perceived as good enough to be loved led meindeed continues to compel meto see every dip and ascension of this roller coaster called life as a means for inner exploration and outer growth The habits birthed in a fearful wish to be loved to be safe and to belong became the structures of my adulthood and how I can help others feel loved safe and that they belong Theres a gift even in the most painful whispered warning If they only knew the real me theyd see how incompetent screwed up broken angry I really am If they really saw through my masks theyd see the awful things Ive done And if they saw those things Id be thrust out of the tribe bereft left to die alone cold unloved and deeply deeply ashamed The gift is often hard to see and is just as often misread It is not what my clients who struggle with their own versions of the impostor syndrome believe it to be It is not the source of some sort of driver a guard against complacency that will compel them to excellence Such a belief is yet another crafty whispered warning from a Loyal Soldier Such a warning is false because implicit in the warning is the fundamental belief that behind it all we are lazy goodfornothing slackers who seek nothing more than to be complacent giving up authorship of our own lives Nothing can be more false The Buddha taught that because we are born human we are inherently basically good Far from being lazy slackers we are born with wishes dreams and the desire to live in tribes with love safety and belonging Who Here Is Brave Enough to Admit Theyre Terrified I paced the stage in front of the gathered large audience of mostly firsttime CEOs The stage was at a convention center in San Francisco As I often do I paused to let the crowd settle down settle into their bodies Id already made a few people laugh by kicking off my shoes explaining to the front row that my feet are so big that my shoes feel heavy and I need to be light The talk was on the challenge of leadership I begin with two questions Who here is brave enough to admit they are terrified And Whos smart enough to admit they havent a clue about how to do their job Everyone laughs Everyone relaxes One gift that emerges from radical selfinquiry is the recognition that the whole system is rigged That only those with extreme mental wellbeing or those with an extreme mental disorder are unbothered by such doubts When were brave enough to admit our fears uncertainties and doubts we open the gift box Putting aside the bright wrapping paper and ribbons our Loyal Soldier has carefully assembled we extract the ability to accept our humanity our flaws the wholeness of our selves Then in opening to our humanity we open to the glorious wondrous gift of our shared humanity Oh we exclaim you feel broken too Awesome lets be human together In loving the gifts of the Crow we end up negating the very threat about which he warned Our soldier so desperate to make sure we dont end up alone told us over and over to hide our doubts By admitting our doubts we get to enjoy one of the great gifts of being human belonging In loving his gifts I learned to love my Crow In loving my Crow Ive begun the painful work of retrieving the parts of me from my black bag The act of leading and the art of growing up depend on each of us finally eventually repeatedly sorting the unsorted baggage weve been traveling with since childhood The Unsorted Baggage of Leadership For those who hold power the price of unsorted baggage is paid by those with whom they pass their daystheir coworkers peers direct reports Of course not all organizational challenges can be traced back to the dismembered unsorted parts of themselves in the leaders shadows But the toughest most intransigent most troubling aspects of the collective unconscious blithely referred to as culture can more effectively be worked when the leader commits to doing selfinquiry work Power in the hands of one afraid or unwilling to look in the mirror perpetuates an often silent always seething violence in the workplace Worse still when a leader leads from his or her shadow the dismembering havoc is perpetuated down the line until the company the tribe the community simply assumes this is how life must be I was called to lead an offsite with a senior leadership team The problem on the table the presenting agenda to use a coaching term was that the company was stuck and the CEO and the board were frustrated by the lack of innovation and progress The morning we were to start the offsite the CEO pulled me aside both the heads of sales and engineering had called in sick This was a problem because each of them was considered a problem Everyone else had already concluded that the aggressive style each of them showed was the reason the company couldnt make any decisions I dont think either of them is really sick the CEO confided in me I think they just dont want to deal with all the touchyfeely stuff you make people talk about I nodded and joked about having a pheromone that makes people cry We began by talking about the ways we listen and the ways we door dontcommunicate I asked about how failure was handled I listened with my head my ears but then listened with my body as well My head was pleased It all sounded right We celebrate failure someone offered I smiled made small talk about failure and mistakes Again it all sounded right But my body felt otherwise and my vigilant heart perked up How do you handle disagreement They looked puzzled and stayed silent I pressed on I mean youve more than a thousand employees now youve got to disagree sometime Do you celebrate that More silence Following my intuition I wandered over to the CEO Tell me how disagreement was handled in your family I asked echoing the work I did with the other conflictavoidant team Was there any violence at home Shocked he said emphatically No Not at all Puzzled I turned away listening to my gut The CEO added quickly Only a lot of yelling I smiled putting a question to the whole room Does anyone on your team ever yell He paused before noting Only those two who didnt show up today With that one move we quickly pieced together their unconscious unspoken cultural rules Conflict was to be avoided at all costs In this case it might lead to unacceptable yelling which is too threatening The result was an incredibly loving culture to which most folks were deeply loyal Most folks To those for whom frustration was an inherent part of experimentation of ambition of drive the culture was to be fought against at every turn Experimentation creates tension It carries a risk of failure Moreover when such experiments succeed and companies innovate people have to integrate change The potential of failure and the need for change can terrify people It can feel like the conflicts from their childhood that folks were programmed to avoid Then those who clearly see the need for change in an organization become the unconscious holders of the tension The frustrations that drove the company to try to change and innovate get banished The falsely safe and loving culture is preserved but the company slowly strangles itself with a lack of new ideas and an inability to confront competitors When the leader is willing to embrace that which has been banishedto embrace without fear the potential of failure for examplethen a company is able to free itself from the false safety of conflict avoidance and change and grow Or consider Julie Her pitches to investors were always perfect and she was on her way to building a killer company one destinedI predictedto radically disrupt the ways economically disadvantaged people received highquality food As part of her preparations shed blast music from the nineties to rev herself up Yet often the deal making would snag Shed get the yes on the merits of the dealthe strong underlying economics of the company and the compelling arguments about the return on investment But often shed struggle to close the transaction Worse still once closed the investors would often end up in an adversarial stance The Crow on her shoulder would sit up stretch its wings and cock an eye looking for signs of trouble Then one day really by accident she heard a story from another CEO who related that before her pitch meetings shed stand still shed sit in meditation Shed go back to an insight shed gained at one of our camps about the deeply held reason why she launched the business in the first place The next day Julie found herself uninterested in the nineties pop shed regularly listened to Instead she just sat As she sat she remembered She remembered the ways her parents struggled to pay the bills she pulled in the fear and the shame that the familys economic challenges had induced in her She wept and through the tears she saw the sevenyearold version of herself being mocked for the crappy unfashionable clothes she wore to school She heard the nineties pop music in her head not as an anthem of survival but as a ballad of the pain of becoming herself I cried so much she told me I was scared because the meeting was only a few minutes away But then when she walked into the room of wealthy powerful men something shifted She opened the pitch not by speaking of the amazing economic opportunity before her but with a simple declaration I grew up poor and I dont think poverty should stop anyone from receiving nutritious food Thats why I launched my company and thats why we should partner The investors were enrapt theyd found not only a company to back but a leader to believe in For some the disowned dismembered parts of themselves show up with a fury At the request of a friend Id begun working with a new client Patricks lead investor said Hes a little rough around the edges but he could really use your help After a few conversations Patrick and I agreed to start the engagement with a performance review Wed interview folks in his life and give him a picture of how they saw him This is the worst 360degree review Ive ever seen I said at the debriefing session His colleagues had described him as bullying toxic enraging and dismissive Patrick had had a chance to review the report before we spoke and he had an unexpected mix of shame and curiosity He was not at all defensive and in fact shared that he felt the descriptions were accurate Following my intuition I encouraged him not to disown the anger behind all that behavior I put his mind at ease by describing how some companies thrive on intense debate Some companies cultures are rock tumblers I said You put dusty dirty roughedup stones into the tumbler and then hours later you end up with polished jewels The stones banging into each other forcing a positive transformation He loved the image I went on The problem is though not everyone wants to work in a rock tumbler And thats okay too but you may soon find yourself with no colleagues Instead we explored his banished anger as if it were an old friend He recalled story after story of being told how wrong he was for being angry and importantly how hed always find some sneaky way to get back at those who told on him In fact I realized that part of the reason he wasnt defensive about the descriptions was that he was used to being called these things In fact he relished it indeed he expected me to slip into the role of the chastising parent or teacher Just another adult telling him bad boy and banishing him to his room I refused to go along and instead said Well I think you have a right to your anger You should be pissed off given your childhood But the question now is what will Patrick the adult choose to do with that anger When Peter explored his inability to celebrate his teams success he found his grandparents who had survived the Nazi pogroms back in Poland by staying low and out of sight and never letting themselves be seen In his own paranoia about his companys competitors he found his grandparents survival instinct embedded in their unshakable belief in the hostility of the world Trace the roots of a leaders boredom with a wellfunctioning team and the desire to shake things up and you may find a fear of complacency that would allow the familys enemies to catch them off guard Or explore a CEOs sexual relationship with her cofounder and you may stumble upon a commitment to selfsabotage to ensure that she never outdoes her father Just because you feel like shit I tell client after client doesnt mean you are shit They laugh and are amused by the line But sometimes we also allow ourselves to unpack that feeling like shit may in fact be old programming ghosts in the machine whose purpose is to ensure belonging What would happen I asked one leader What would happen if you let go of the belief in your fundamental brokenness How would your life be if you didnt need to believe you were broken to feel loved How would the experience of your life change if you could rest and trust that lifes goodness isnt always necessarily followed by calamity How would the meat bag that is your body feel if you were to let go of the need to feel negativeabout yourself your partners the futureand know simply that while sometimes bad follows good just as often good follows bad How would it feel if we trusted that no matter how bad our actions those who truly know usknow the person whom were convinced only the Crow and our Loyal Soldier knowwould love us Perhaps it can be that when a loved one dies suddenly amid that grief we will find hope and salvation Or that when a stranger attacks us on the subway knocks us unconscious with blood gushing from our nose and a broken tooth lying next to our dazed head we can awaken to marvel at the caring efficiency of a young New York City police officer as she presses the speeddial button on your phone the one marked Home Or amid the blood and broken bone we feel the wise hands of an even younger emergency room nurse at Bellevue Hospitalhis hands gently cradling your head as he asks if you know what year it is and the name of the president What would it be like if we were to stop externalizing responsibility for our inner state onto the Irrational Other What would the experience of being in community in our organizations be like if instead of overtly or covertly asking others to bear responsibility for giving us the feeling of love we each assumed our worthiness as our birthright and no longer needed to twist and warp the other to suit our desperate wish to ease our sense of brokenness What would our organizations be like if we could drop the collective need to identify and ostracize the latest demonthe one who simply doesnt get us or our culture How would the lives of our colleagues and even more important the lives our colleagues children develop over time if we removed the Coney Island fun house mirrors of our unconscious biases and projections Swim in your own lane I often admonish a client When youre in the water stay focused on the goalyour customersand not on what the competitor is doing Paranoia about the competitorthe nameless faceless Other whose existence threatens our wishes and dreamshas for so long been a mantra in business Only the paranoid survive has been repeated ad nauseam and for so long that few pause to question the roots of the paranoia a Loyal Soldier firmly defending mine from yours dividing our organizations and our communities into us and them the Irrational Others Few people question the ways such division of the world categorically implies that the world is hostile and everyone in it is out to get us Perhaps those in the other lane are merely vying for their own safety Perhaps those in the lanes to our left and to our right are just scared terrified that they too will be found out as lazy goodfornothing slackers Competition is healthy Striving to do well is in its way life affirming But what do we do to our organizations when we define ourselves by the existence of the Other When we presume that the competitor in the lane next to ours is wrong bad or a threat we are allowing our deepest fears about our own inadequacy to stand in as our vision statement and strategic plan An unintended whispered consequence is that our colleaguesour friends down the hall with whom we built this thing this product this service this companymay fear that they too are them How will our leadership change when we see that there is no them and that there is only us How will our communities shift if were able to stop seeing our leaders as objects of our projections but as merely brokenhearted warriors striving to be a little bit better each day One founder of a highintegrity nearly spiritual community asked in frustration why her colleagues seemed to no longer listen to her concerns despite their having been so well articulated Perhaps I suggested they cant hear you because theyre too busy listening to their idea of you For that too is part of the merrygoround of shadow and projection especially with organizations with the highest intentions whose collective Loyal Soldiers banish their fearcovering aggressions We are often so programmed by old ghosts in the machine to see the leader as the epitome of all that we are not that we fail to see their failings their flesh and blood their feet of clay We cant allow ourselves to see that if we prick them they will bleed Such projections can be dizzying What if instead of projecting the best of ourselves onto the Other we took back that part of ourselves with love and laughter What if instead of projecting our banished dangerous rage onto the Other we were to take it back and welcome it in What if we saw the Other as a mirror and a pathway to our growth Our organizations might then turn away from the impulses to do violence to the self the community and the planet and toward being the means for each of us to grow up Loving the Crow and Retrieving the Treasure Of all the many gifts Dr Sayres gave to me the one Im most grateful for comes in the form of an exasperated response to my endless worry that I was not good enough Oh Jerry shed say cutting me off youre incorrigible Somehow over the years I took that in my Crow squawked and relaxed and I reveled even in my incorrigibility my basically good humanity and loved my way past all the whispered warnings of Crows and Soldiers This then is the highest calling of the warriorleader to take our seats as humans and build humane companies communities where it is gloriously safe for others to be human The leaderthe person living into the immense sky of that honorificis called to use the gifts of inquiry to see which dragons we may be running from and which princesses we may be running toward To notice with loving attention if were overindexing on either the soft open front of the warrior or the strong back For humane organizations are those that sit still staying firmly in that place between the strong back of good processes fiscal clarity firmly held beliefs and values and the soft open heart of wisdom empathy and fierce gentleness By taking back the projected qualities by retrieving the treasure were less likely to build organizations that mimic and reinforce the wars of our childhood and more likely to build communities of belonging and emerge the adults we deserve to be We get to become the adults we needed when we were children Were less likely then to be confused and seduced by notions of self loathing Were less likely to lack an understanding of why good people ourselves included do bad things Despite there being so many companies striving to create cultures declaring their intent to do no evil we see that by banishing the possibility of doing evil we nearly ensure that evil will be done This path of warrior leadership isnt for the faint of heart I laugh loudly when folks suggest that this is some sort of yogainspired softbellied call to leadership Namaste my ass I say with my Brooklynborn chip firmly squarely and proudly on my shoulder Try entering the cave walking to the dark recesses and retrieving the treasure waaay in the back Then come tell me about being soft Long ago in response to dreadful migraines Id developed as a child Dr Sayres taught me the first of three magical questions What am I not saying that needs to be said Consider that question alone when you consider your own wayward twisting tackingacrossthesurfaceofthe lake path to leadership and adulthood What have I not been saying recently in the last few years in all my life that needs and needed to be said Consider and check your heart rate That beat beat beat you feel is not love but the dread felt at approaching fierce fearful truth Consider the ways the unsorted baggage of your life has kept you from not only speaking but being heard What am I saying thats not being heard Consider how youve silently seethed waiting to manipulate the team to prove that you were right all along Consider the ghosts in your machine the click click of the boltaction rifle warning you of the dangers of truly listening to those with whom you share this Earth this journey Whats being said that Im not hearing What is it that the people whom I love the people I work with the people who populate the stories of my life are saying that I just cant bear to hear Is it perhaps that I have hurt them disappointed them or threatened their safety Can I consider that my refusal to hear themregardless of their chosen method of communicationfurthers that pain Consider these things and tell me again how this path of leadership is soft The commitment to sort the unsorted baggage turns leadership into a journey of selfactualization With that work becomes not the impediment to our lives not the repeated manifestation of our inner selfloathing not the thing that gets in the way but the way we can live out our lives as they were meant to be As the poet John ODonohue wishes for each of us May leadership be for you A true adventure of growth Such inner work creates alignment and alignment strengthens purpose and meaning Welcoming home the Loyal Soldier and loving the Crow release us from the lacerations of guilt and shame and allow the warriors within to claim their seat Love the Crow and grow Journaling Invitations How has who I am shaped the ways I lead others and myself Which of my unconscious patterns might be showing up in my organization How have those patterns benefited my organization How might they be holding it back Chapter 8 Heartbreak Resilience and the Path to Equanimity The Heartbreak of Every Day Heres a fact to break your heart chestnut trees parents children friends lovers and dreams all die Our childrenstepping into our footprintsstruggle fumbling their way through to adulthood bearing skinned and scarred knees broken hearts and the imprint of wretched disappointment They manage this while navigating the unrelenting compulsion to find the person they were born to be toiling against forces that would have them be someone else The resulting heartbreak becomes the means of selfdiscovery and ultimately self creation A CEO develops a rare blood cancer and funding for the company is threatened A fianc calls off the wedding a month before the ceremony A marriage ends when a spouse dies Customers reject us Investors abandon us Our companies the embodiments of our wishes and dreams crash and burn after years of riding the roller coaster Our ability to love and be loved to feel safe and that we belong is challenged daily by the everydayness of heartbreak and struggle We struggle with these painful realitiesof birth old age sickness and deathtrying desperately usually vainly to see the heartbreak of every day not as evidence of our own unworthiness and unlovability but as life merely unfolding as intended That struggle exacerbates the everyday pain we struggle to accept the rollercoaster ride for what it is life We compound that pain by misunderstanding the notion of resiliency the capacity to bounce back So often were told that we should be resilient but were rarely handed a map to get there Worse we mistakenly believe that arriving at that state is the point of it all The point of riding the roller coaster isnt to be better at riding roller coasters its to learn how not to board the roller coaster at all Coney Islands Cyclone is best appreciated from the ground Resiliency isnt the goal its the path The goal is the equanimity of a warrior The first step on the path of resiliency and the movement toward a warriors equanimity are taken by having your heart broken open by the everyday skinning of your childs knee the dismembering of a tree or the death of a spouse Failure and the Passage of Trees I find impermanence to be the most heartrending attribute of the passage of time As a boy the horse chestnut tree provided the safety of a hollow in which I could temporarily escape the shame of our poverty and the angry confusing yelling that would often enough lead to violence As a boy I found love deep within the falldropped spiky chestnut which remained milky white and soft and cool to the touch I found safety when that milky white softness would emerge after weeks buried deep in my sock drawer with the shimmering sienna of a blood bay Arabian As a boy I found belonging beneath the spreading fivefingered leaves of the tree as my best friend Marcus and I tossed a football high into the branches hoping to knock down clusters of the spikyskinned nuts And then came the day when Id heard the beepbeepbeep of the yellow orange New York City Parks Department payloader as it backed up to scoop up another load of the newly cut sawdusty logs that were once in total the chestnut tree now felled My sanctuary gone Beepbeepbeep Its gone its gone its gone Id wept into my mothers apron her hand stroking my head smoothing the muscles of my neck The heartfelt there there of my mothers comforting drawing me into the knowledge that through it all here in that place of heartache confusion and fear was the love of home Here one minute gone the next heartbreak leading to comfort Im haunted by the smell of freshly cut wood Polar explorer Ben Saunders first contacted me in 2008 I was still finding my footing as a coach and he needed someone to help him figure out how to finance his passion the work he was born to do Or so he told me I was only a few days out he began when the ski binding broke and I had to call the whole thing off A few months earlier hed set out to establish a new recordthe fastest to ski to the North Pole and back from the Canadian approach A few days in the entire enterprise had failed And here he was broke with no means of support His entrepreneurial endeavor had run out of cash and a friend had said I might help him figure out how to raise money to keep the effort alive I startled him by noting that it must have sucked to have had to call it off He laughed with relief It was nice to hear someone say simply Well that sucked But then as I recall he started to crywhich I know now was not what he expected when hed called the entrepreneurs coach Do I even have a superpower Kent CavenderBares asked me when we recorded our conversation for a podcast His wife having heard another episode had encouraged him to listen and then reach out to talk His question in response to my exploration of how those things weve tossed into our shadow have a deep power that when accessed with compassion and skill can drive our creativity He cried quietly when I noted that his struggle must be so painful Behind his question lay the heartbreak that comes from having struggled so mightily to launch a businessin this case a robot designed to help farmers apply fertilizer and pesticides more efficient and less harmful to the land they caretake Kents dream is to heal the land while enabling people to grow more food The heartbreak evident in his implicit questions What if my deep integrity my commitment to simply telling how it is is the reason were unable to fundraise Do I even have a superpower Would the company be better off with someone else as CEO Would my family and the world be better off if I stopped trying so hard to be an entrepreneur and just went back to the world of work where we are seen merely as Tab A headed for Slot B This Ride Is Dark and Scary While heartbreak is the early step on the path to equanimity fear is the stumbling block leading to the sin of inaction Fearing the dark rides of the Coney Island of the mind we choose not to act Fearing Paris we stay close to home Fearing broken skis failed businesses and the scars that come from skinned knees we stay smalllistening more to our Loyal Soldiers fearfilled and protective whispered warnings than to the quickening thump thump thumpthump thumpthump of a heart that knows how its meant to be Fear and not some lack of grit or resiliency blocks the emergence of our fully actualized and equanimous self The warrior crouches behind walls of fear Life should come with a placard WARNING THIS RIDE IS DARK AND SCARY What is it we fear Well first the threats to love safety and belonging But really we fear death the pain of freshly cut logs from the felled sanctuary hurts We fear shame because it rends our sense of who we might be andwe believethreatens our worthiness to be loved We fear love because the object of our love may jump ship and abandon us leaving us as bereft as a tenyearold boy amid the cut logs of a sanctuary tree We fear the change inherent in our children growing into adulthood the death of those close to us the end of decadeslong relationships My fear of impermanence leads me to wish to hold even the bittersweet painful moments of life in amber preserved like a prehistoric insect to be admired but ironically no longer lived This morning as I slipped on my sneakers I was overwhelmed by a memory of shopping with my daughter Emma She must have been five She needed new sneakers and being the efficient shopper that I am I snatched her up and took her to the local mall I waitedpatiently I told myselffor her to choose which of the hundreds of pairs her fiveyearold heart would like The chosen pair fitted I paid at the register and with her tiny hand in mine we walked briskly from the store Daddy she asked slightly out of breath as her little legs strode to keep pace with my much larger more important daddylegs Daddy did you ever buy something and she paused caught her breath and continued and realize after youve left the store that you really wanted the other thing Screech Stop I looked down to see fearful tears running down her cheeks In my bid to be an efficient effective father I had failed to be with her and feel her heart I bent picking her up in one motion and apologized for moving so quickly in the world that I did not notice my little girls heart I want to hold forever the bitterness of my having forgotten her and the sweetness of my having been called to take my seat as a warrior dad I want to remember forever that we marched back to that store and bought a second pair because in the end it didnt matter that having worn the shoes outside the store we couldnt return those wrong shoes The warrior dad bought the right shoes the shoes his daughter wanted and was reminded of the importance of listening to his little girls heart I want to be haunted by that bittersweet feeling forever out of such heartbreak grew the resiliency with which I learned to listen to the fearful hearts of those I love and ride through the heartbreak of every day The Lovingkindness of True Grit I often speak of resiliency and no matter how much I try to do otherwise I still manage to come across as if Im speaking about grit So Ill speak of grit True grit is more than the capacity to grin and bear it To understand true grit we need to understand false grit False grit is brittle Its the sense that we are nothing if we cant take a punch In fact we define taking a punch as the ability to not feel pain when we are punched False grit is dangerous It feeds a stubbornness that in turn can feed delusion We mistake the tendency to delude ourselves that our relationship will improve our companies will succeed if only we double down on our old patterns grip the steering wheel until our knuckles whiten and bear down Stubbornness is not the hallmark of the warrior Leaders who persist out of stubbornness believing themselves to be gritty are at best delusional and at worst reckless False grit awakens the Crow One of its implicit messages is that we should persist to prove that we arent as unworthy as the Crow claims Yet a second implicit message is that if we feel like shit after being punched in the face it must mean that we are shit The only way to escape the grip of false grit is to recognize its falsity True grit is kind True grit is persistent True grit persists not in holding on to false beliefs against all evidence but in believing in ones inherent lovability and worthiness True grit is the leader believing in the teams purpose its capacity to overcome obstacles and the relevancy of the cause True grit acknowledges the potential of failure embraces the fear of disappointment and rallies the team to reach and try regardless of the potential of loss True grit the capacity to stick with something to the end stems from knowing oneself well enough to be able to forgive oneself To have inquired deeply and steadily enough to find the deep sense of purpose that is beyond a personal mission statement In that knowing of oneself one is then able to stand as a single warrior amid a community of brokenhearted fellow leaders We see true grit in the lovingkindness of compassionate leaders those who embody the Buddhist principle of bodhicitta and strive to be of service to others I feel the truth of that and yet I battle my own obstacles How do you serve others when your heart is pained and your warrior is terrified Sitting with Suffering I sat still in a stuffy white tent despite the nearly unbearable August heat in the mountains of Colorado Six years after my first encounter with Pema Chdrn I took in her teachings again Lateafternoon thunderstorms rolled in the distance promising cool relief We were three hundred students in all many sobbed gently while they watched their breath and eased their monkeyminds At the talk that followed the sitting Id made my way to the microphone to ask a question Ani Pema I asked my voice breaking slightly as I used her honorific title How do I forgive those who hurt me so badly How do I free myself from the haunting pain of my childhood Shading her eyes to see the questioner more clearly she smiled and said Oh hello Jerry She then recounted the story of the woman who having suffered the unbearable heartbreak of the death of her child was asked by the Buddha to go to every household of those who had not suffered heartbreak and collect a mustard seed Of course she smiled gently the woman came back to the Buddha emptyhanded The point wasnt for me to make small my suffering by comparing myself to others The point was to lean into the universality of the suffering Id like you to add a practice to your meditation she answered Please consider all the childrenyourself includedfrom the past present and future who have are and will suffer equally Send them love I began doing that opening my heart to exactly that searing piercing painthe universal pain of children who do not feel loved safe or that they belongand I sat still with all our suffering Years later I astonished myself by concluding that in the wake of an earthquake in an area called Yushu in the ethnically Tibetan region of China I would do what I could to alleviate suffering I was astonished by the impulse Id never done anything like that before I rode into the devastated city five months after the quake Buildings everywhere lay toppled and amid the piles of rubble that had been homes clinics and schools the streets were barely discernible At least there arent bodies in the streets anymore said one of my guides a woman whod been in Yushu shortly after the quake We then spent our days handing out thick cotton tents blankets and other supplies We wandered through the rubble trying to help as we could We came across a man caring for a deaf and mute nun the stench of her incontinence overwhelming Hed lost his wife the morning of the earthquake The stupa the sacred hemispherical structure containing relics around which shed been making her ritualistic circumambulation had toppled with the quake killing her He wept in gratitude for the food clothing and blankets we left Putting his hands together he spoke a rapid Tibetan One of my friends Sonam another Tibetan guide began crying as he spoke with the man Assuming he was giving us thanks I asked Sonam what hed said He was praying that if an earthquake should happen again and if a life needs to be taken it should be him for hed never want another person to feel the heartbreak that he now feels Heartbreak is universal Keeping ones heart open to the suffering of others even upon the failure of our companies and the death of a tree is rare and the truest grit of all True grit is an expression of resiliency True grit is not only having your heart broken open by the death of a chestnut tree the killing fall of a stupas stonework and the swoon of a rollercoaster drop but its also managing to keep that heart open despite those losses Bodhicitta means awakened mind but it connotes open heart Your mind cannot awaken while your heart remains closed When leaders allow their hearts to stay broken open theyre able to recognize that the suffering they encounter every day among their employees colleagues and investors is universal Their fear of failure for example is the very same fear their investors carry It may be distorted by the funhouse effect of the investors structural powerdistorted by the investors Loyal Soldier and other shadowed qualities into an aggression but it is nevertheless the same fear All loss threatens the love safety and belonging of even those who hold power During your next board meeting collect a mustard seed from all those present who dont worry that the companys failure will threaten their love safety and sense of belonging During your next allhands staff meeting collect mustard seeds from all those who havent feared the loss of their job disappointing their loved ones having their Crows exhortations about their impostor status proved correct or otherwise tumbling backward down the staircase of life Attempt to collect those mustard seeds and then stare at your empty hands As leaders our task is to feel our way through the heartbreaking fear inducing rollercoaster rides learning not to vomit with each rise and dip Then just as weve built up the resiliency needed to recover from each nauseating dip we find that we no longer have the need for it The little train that makes up the Cyclone comes to a stop and we finally wisely get off the ride Listening for Equanimity My sister Nicki has tacked up above her desk at work a quote I once gave to a reporter She tells me it makes her proud of me Id said that equanimity boils down to this Everythings great and Im okay Everything sucks and Im okay Through years of radically inquiring within my brokenopen heart sitting still with that pain and its universal nature Ive been able to experience the occasional true equanimity Sitting still listening to the Earth I learned the power of contented simplicity Ten years ago I made one of my teachers laugh out loud when I told him of my plans to go on a vision quest Having migrated from China as a boy he spent most of his fifty years in the United States Having been born in China hed still occasionally use the you Americans construction You Americans he said with a shake of his head You think you can schedule a vision Laughing he asked Do you think insight is going to coincide with your vacation His doubts notwithstanding I left my home on Long Island and traveled to the four corners where Nevada Colorado Utah and Arizona meet My own doubts notwithstanding I traveled to sit in a kiva with guides whoI did not know at the timewould become my lifelong friends My own fears notwithstanding I found myself asking permission from a twisted and gnarled pine before tying up my shelter to use its branches for support My selfconsciousness notwithstanding I found myself hearing a new name for myself as the wind bent and shook the tops of the pines all around me During my solo time a time of fasting and solitude I connected to the love safety and belonging that came not from those around me but from my own self Oh so this is who I am I said astonished by my discovery Oh this this is my pain Sheltered by only a thin yellow sheet of nylon naked except for light khaki shorts taking small sips of water so as not to die in the desert with no books no journal no other means of distraction from the essence of me I sat still my skin raw and exposed my senses widening with an animal ferocity I heard everything I felt the Earths passage through space and therefore time I heard the wisdom of boulders older than humans I walked among shards of busted pottery older than the United States I heard stories told by a people who railed against the impermanence of their lives by leaping desert chasms to leave handprints on canyon walls Hearing all that I dug deep into the sandbank of the river from which I drew my water I lit a fire and praised those whod guided me to this point in my life Under the gaze of millenniaold boulders I vomited the heartbreak and pain of my childhood wounds until my throat was raw my cheeks burned by tears and my stomach pained and emptied had nothing to offer I had no need beyond a thin sheet of nylon a few sips of water and knowledge that the Earth was able to hold and witness all that I have been all that I am and all that I will become I sat in that contented simplicity as Grandfather Boulder lovingly held it all receiving it as if to say Even with all this you are still my son You are loved you are safe and you belong to me as surely as your brothers and sisters the boulders The Earth held me and I then learned the equanimity that comes from listening I returned the favor with a poem of my own Listen On a brightening morning When dark places seem furthest Brother Warrior comes Helping me remember me He stands with legs firmly rooted in the earth arms at his side palms open back strong heart exposed You were not given this life to carry only your sorrow You were not given this life only to lament Make holy that which you were given Go and listen Over his shoulder Grandfather Boulder With his neverending smile Looks on his two sons of the Earth Listening he reminds opens that which pain has closed In listening we are healing We are never healed but forever healing We are never loved but forever loving Our hearts close and we become both the builders and wardens of our prisons our mindforged manacles rattling with shame and fearful cries of our unlovability Listening he taught me breaks the chains Listening to others Ani Pema taught me snaps the bonds of our woeful lamentations Listening to ourselves deep selfinquiry turns resiliency into growth and equanimity My rightful appropriate healthy response to the wounds of childhood was anger Unmet disregarded the anger turned into rage Lacking the skills to work with the anger and rage it would manifest into an anxious doubt about my safety my belonging Yet despite that jujitsu move of anger into anxiety my underlying rage remained Hulk remained Following the Grandfather Boulders instructions to listen to my own self I began to inquire after my rage to look at the fears and the pain that lay behind it I visualized that rage as the sweating redfaced boy whose only way of surviving was to try to chase with fury those who would humiliate him Assuring that boy that he had a right to his anger I then asked about the ways hed been denied and banished I asked after the hurt behind the rage and sat still with the stories he shared Slowly slowly and working together we reassigned the rage The red faced little boy no longer needed to chase and smash to guard against shame That fierce rage stopped being a dangerous enemy and became a fierce guardian of the scared and less powerful The redfaced boy transformed into the guardian of my tender open heart I listened to myself I grew Just as I Am I Am Enough At our boot camps the simple power of a walk with a friend often comes across like magic With a few simple instructions such as listen and dont fix folks come back from a twentyminute stroll weeping having experienced the power of listening and of being heard Or having the burden of a secret held to keep others safe lifted and shared making the load just a little lighter We gathered in a circle to reflect on what had happened and to tell each others stories When Alisha heard her partner say the word burden once twice and finally three times she began crying I never knew I carried that word burden so deeply She then shared a story of growing up in a family that felt like a burden on the whole town Beloved they depended on the kindness of strangers And rather than enhancing the sense of belonging that came from community it manacled Alisha with the shame of poverty When her pillar ofthecommunity father left the family no doubt in pursuit of his own love safety and belonging she took on the burden of caring for her mother and brother Yet another hallmark of the entrepreneur yet another instance of premature promotion into adulthood She built a company on the foundations of a business shed launched in her teens One designed to generate a profit no matter how small from day one And furthermore one never in need of capitalnever a burden to others But this complex of never be a burden and always relieve others burdens became a prison and behind those bars her resentment grew On her walk she shared things about herself that she wished the people in her life knew about her As her partner listened she was able to hear her story and the rattling of her manacles She heard the fear shame and pain behind her resentful anger toward her brother Later she went for a walk with her mother and brother They listened to each other The healing that followed the listening became a retelling and reimagining of the narrative of heartbreak that dominated their childhood of poverty and abandonment confusion and shame The listening led to a healing that moved them past the resiliency of well never be a burden to others into the equanimity of the acceptance of the pain while dropping the shackles of the story of the pain The stories they told about their experience were transformed from instruments of survival into nolongerneeded artifacts in an otherwise equanimous life Learning to listen as I have done helped me inquire into my own ways to see my ghosts and programmed ways of being Listening with an open nonjudging heart allowed me to learn when Id had enough of the world and its harsh need to change me into someone I am not That learned declaration of enough supports the grittiest most equanimous expression possible that as brokenopen as I may be I am enough Just as I am I am enough The Space Between Clouds and Waves The space between whats wrong and right is where youll find me hiding sings Dave Matthews The space between is where I am and the me thats hiding there is enough One of the most striking images from my many trips to Tibet was the reverently preserved dried skulls of great teachers Occasionally usually in the homes of a village elder youll see among treasured items the top half of such a skull Moving beyond the impulse to recoil at such objects Im always drawn in by the firmly held belief that amid the scribbles of what must have been bone meeting brain are auspicious imprints testifying to the holiness of the departed Its believed that the scribbly indentations on the underside of the skulls of great teachers often form the shape of a sitting Buddha Buddhists believe so fervently in the power of equanimity the fundamental basic goodness of all beings the fundamental Buddhanature of all things that they see the Buddha in stones trees skies and the bones of longdead teachers Buddhanature resides in the most unexpected places In my struggle to fully take in the fundamental goodness of all things myself included I strained to see what was so clear to my host in his delicate relic Even now his wishing to believe as well as his wish to be believed is seared into my consciousness fixed in place by the sensuous smell of burning dried yak dung For me such is Tibet It was in Tibet that I first tasted the equanimity that arises from wishing that the pain of death loss and failure were mine to bear easing the lived experiences of those around me From my time in Tibet I came to understand what clouds and waves can teach us about facing suffering with true grit Of all the Buddhist saints Ive come to know only Milarepa seems like someone who could have been raised in Brooklyn Its not merely his Eat me if you wish attitude in the face of monstrous demons that makes me feel like he could have walked down Flatbush Avenue Its the story of his heartbreak turned into resilience and equanimity His father died when he was just a boy and his life of wealth comfort and ease were turned upside down Promoted prematurely he took on the burden of caring for his now bereft family In her heartbreak his mother encouraged him to take up black magic His leadership skills were honed at the whetstone of his mothers suffering and anger He traveled the area robbing and murdering Its said that he wore the fingerbones of his murder victims as a necklace Later he met the great teacher Marpa who through a series of backbreaking and ego demolishing tasks helped Milarepa become a saintly poet and beloved meditation master In one of the many songs that define his teachings a student asks the master I can contemplate the sky but clouds make me uneasy Milarepa tell me how to meditate on clouds Tell me in effect how I can achieve equanimity when the clouds get in the way of my seeing the empty immense sky The student goes on and asks again about the difficulty he has in meditating on the calm beauty and serenity of the sea when all he can see is the waves Wise Milarepa the young boy who turned his suffering into violence only to learn how to truly be with his pain answers If the skys as easy as you say clouds are just the skys play He then adds that waves are just the seas play We cant separate the clouds from sky or the waves from the sea There is no space between our thoughts however painful they might be and our mind Let your mind stay within the sea he advises and so too Let your mind stay within your mind This Too Shall Pass Whether the heartbreak of daily life leads to resiliency and equanimity is then a function of seeing the clouds the waves and thoughts at play Every rise and fall of the roller coaster is life at play What then is equanimity Its the space between right and wrong guilt and innocence sad and happy greedy and satiated Its the space between wishing things were different from what they are and bitterly giving up and giving in to the fuckmylifeness of the world and its harsh pain of birth old age sickness and death Its the space where dissatisfied with life as it is we strive forward despite knowing that our efforts may fail will likely fail We build our companies our castles in the sky our mandala sand paintings knowing that the winds will inevitably shift and all will be gone Its the space where despite the death of a tree we can feel the glorious reassurance that all shall be well For me equanimity feels like coming home to a house I once occupied before I lost the ability to see the waves the clouds and my thoughts at play In the ten years Ive known Ben Saunders Ive never once asked him why he does the whole polar thing Part of the reason I didnt ask was that I always thought that doing so would annoy him But another reason why I didnt ask was that I knew he was out on the ice looking for something I was just never entirely sure what it was he was looking for In his attempt to complete his friend Henrys journey the solo crossing of Antarctica it became clear to me what it was he was looking for As Ive written about midway through the first leg of the journey Ben was struggling with the formidable sastrugi the winddriven ridges on the surface of rockhard snow His progress was slow and it was becoming apparent that unless he cut his rations in half hed run out of food before he could be resupplied He was faced with either stopping short of his goal a failure from a false grit point of view or plunging on risking his life and dying as his friend Henry had done During our satellite phone call when Id given him the Zenlike advice to take only small steps I struggled to understand my role Was I supposed to encourage him to soldier on or was I to tell him to call it quits Soon enough I dropped my own notions of fixing the situation and simply listened As we talked I heard something different in his voice Yes as he often did when we spoke while he was on the ice he complained about how challenging things were He was hungry He was tired He was cold But this time I noticed a calmness in his voice and when we spoke about his stopping the trip early he said something remarkable Jerry he said speaking of his then fiance and now wife Philippa Pip Ive now got someone to come home to I realized then what it was that kept him going to the ice hed been looking for home All humans seek love safety and belonging For years I thought Ben wandered the cold deserts because he was looking for love safety and belonging Through his struggle with the sastrugi with the potential heartbreak of failing to live up to his heroic challenge of finishing his friend and mentor Henrys dream Ben came to the resiliency of carrying on and the true grit of stopping the journey when continuing would have been madness With Pip in mind he found the way to the love safety belonging and equanimity of home I remember lying on Dr Sayress couch speaking of the hole in my chest that never seemed to close and I shared the memory of my Howdy Doody puppet Howdy Doody the twofootlong plug for that hole in my chest Each night I hugged him tightly wishing hed enter me filling that space inside that deep emptiness that seemed forever a part of me What did he feel like she asked me Mine Me I dont know like a piece of me the missing piece of me Mom uncomfortable that her son was so attached to a doll shamed me for loving him and in that shame I secreted him away in a closet Boys dont cry Boys dont play with dolls Boys dont have holes in their hearts How did it feel when he was gone she asked Empty I was bereft Like when the horse chestnut tree was cut down she offered gently understanding me in a way few have ever Exactly Without the tree without my friend I was bereft homeless unsheltered and ill prepared to face the world Did I even deserve to feel at home I asked through tearfilled doubts Did I even deserve equanimity She quieted my fears and yet again shared with me wisdom from her own life experience Oh Jerry she said with that so comforting chiding of a loving and understanding parent Dont you know that this too shall pass Gam zeh yaavor Shed shared that phrase This too shall pass for years Id walk into her office high from the glorious achievements of my hardfought life Shed laugh and tell me she was proud of me and then lovingly remind me that this too shall pass Just as frequently shed offer the same wisdom when the heartbreaks of the past and present would threaten to overwhelm me Oh Jerry dont you know that this too shall pass She was right of course I learned to use each heartbreakbe it the memory of feeling bereft and ripped open by heartache or a present experience of being overwhelmed by disappointment and griefas a reminder of that wisdom The hole in my chestthe space between wishing for a world that could be and seeing the world as it iswas filled by the blessing of equanimity and the gravity of life at times when I was felled by the deaths of loved ones dreams and trees but also enlightened and lifted by grace Met by true grit my heartbreak gave way to true belonging true peace of mind and truly coming home Journaling Invitations How has my heart been broken What have I learned about myself as a result of that heart being broken In what ways do I embody resiliency What does a life of peace and equanimity feel like Chapter 9 Leadership and the Art of Growing Up For Parker Lilac honeysuckle and diesel fumes perfumed the air as a stream of cars thumped across the expansion joints of the Brooklyn Bridge On that late spring night Chad Dickerson and I shared tears and beer while considering not only the course of our lives but especially the twists of the most recent weeks What had led Chad to be fired from his role as CEO at Etsy What had he done wrong Had he been the CEO we both thought he was I struggled with my own doubts Had I his coach and consigliere failed him Had each of us in our own way simply not been good enough We sat beside each other on the top of the picnic table shoulders nearly touching allowing our brokenopen hearts to lead us both to a place of inquiry and warriorship We took in the possibility of each of our failures We considered all that wed done right and all that wed regretted Andour backs unbentwe clinked bottles and toasted acknowledging how much wed each grown We knew that Chad in announcing his departure and leaving the team hed led for six years would have to bring forth the dignity and grace that lay within his body since his North Carolina boyhood The grace and dignity of a man toiling at a project not because it might bring wealth or approbation but because it was his job to do it Standing next to him I glimpsed the strength of his father who led road repair gangs making the highways safe for North Carolinians to drive to work to school to church to the store for a loaf of bread Good work done well for the right reasons As I think backunder those bright starsit wasnt just Chads warrior that emerged I too was transformed I too had to reach deep inside to find and take my seat That latespring night two men sat on a picnic table on a Brooklyn rooftop as cars and trucks pounded out a ceaseless rhythm Two men sat on a rooftop and rediscovered the true leaders the true warriors the true adults waiting to come forth As the lilachoneysuckledieselperfumed air filled their lungs it mixed with a hint of the stickysweet smell of sour lemon drops and the two men used those stars to chart a way ahead While Chad began to find his postCEO way that night I too rediscovered the warrior within A decade ago in a desert in Utah Grandfather Boulder instructed me to listen and in so doing open that which pain had closed I cut short my wondering if his pain was my failing I let go of that fear knowing this scene wasnt about me I saw clearly that my job had never been to save to fix or to prevent my friend from failing My job remained what it had always been to listen to bear witness and in doing so to midwife the birth of the warrior My work isnt to save anyone from the heartbreak of everydaynot my clients not my children not my friends not my loves If I were I to manage to pull it off I would end up standing in the way of their finding equanimity My work is to bear witness to the growth of those whom I love and care for My work is to stand shoulder to shoulder as when two men sat on a rooftop and found their way to the love safety belonging and equanimity of brokenhearted warriors Taking your seat allowing your heart to break and stay open accepting all the ways you strive to feel love safety and belonging allow you to let go of the striving and welcome in equanimity Striving No More The angle of the lateafternoon Colorado sun intensified both its light and heat I moved to lower the shade cutting the glare and the burn My friend Brad Feld and I sat on his back porch while his golden retrievers vied for our affection We spoke of big and small things We reminisced We recalled stories from two decades of friendship We caught up on recent stories presentday stories of lives unfolding hearts breaking and the gravity that comes from becoming more and more ourselves Im working harder than Id like he tells me as we both nod recognizing the tendency in each of us to do that We know that neither of us will ever really stop working for us working means thinking talking connecting and creating The difference now he says referring to his fiftysomething self the difference from earlier in my life is simple Im no longer striving Seat taken he no longer needs to define himself by what hes doing Seat taken he can allow the sadness of everyday heartbreakhis and that of those he lovesto wash over and through him Seat taken the gentle openhearted warrior emerges and we laugh and speak of our approaching elderhood Taking your seat leads to equanimity Taking your seat means defining your life Acknowledging that which youve come to regret while seeing the possibilities in all thats before you Seat taken you get to define your leadership and your life Or I suppose your life in this moment for the process of becoming doesnt ever end Its always unfolding Life is growth and change and while the impermanence of time passing is heartbreaking it creates the ground from which the new me the warrior in me emerges This is life unfolding as intended This is becoming the warrior adult This is the gift of leadership This is the art of growing up The Gifts of Leadership So much of what Ive learned about growing up came from learning to lead In fact the process of becoming me made me a better leader The two processes becoming a leader and becoming ourselves are intertwined and interdependent better leaders are better humans and better humans are better leaders Leadership lessons then are at their core lessons in humanity Sometimes the belief systems that are most difficult to overcome arent the ghosts in the machine of our childhood Sometimes the most difficult belief systems fall under the rubric of conventional wisdom Conventional wisdom for example dictates that in our process of becoming warriorleaders we focus on the hard things Big rocks folks say knowingly Break down the big rocks and then focus on the little rocks But how do you discern a big rock from a little rock Moreover when were in that haironfire state and the Crow is cawing relentlessly about the risks of failure even the easy things become hard Conventional wisdom doesnt tell us that when you care so much when the risk of heartbreak is so high when the potential loss of respect and self esteem and the risk of humiliation and attendant shame from your bitter and sure defeat by life are so great its all big rocks and its all hard But with discernment with radically inquiring within we can separate the hard and complicated from the hard and simple In fact forget focusing on the easy or hard learn to distinguish between the complicated and the simple Running a business for example is simple As my grandfather would say just make sure you have more money at the end of the day than you did at the beginning of the day Make sure you have enough money so your grandson can always find safety and love in a canister of lemon drops Simple but hard What makes hard things like running a business complicated is leaders avoiding doing their work When we dont do our work we stand in the way of our own growth When we fail to grow we hold back others and we warp and twist the organizations we seek to serve We turn the work of others into the work of covering up our failings plugging the holes in our chests and living out the commands of the ghosts in our machines What makes all of life complicated and not just hard is this unwillingness to do the work thats ours to do our unwillingness to live the examined life When leaders fail to look at themselves they turn their inner turmoil and very human contradictions outward Further unable to face their fears they mask the anxiety with aggression As my friend and mentor Parker Palmer teaches Violence is what we do when we dont know what to do with our suffering Violence to our planet violence to our communities and violence to ourselves are what we do when we refuse to look inward and work with the heartbreak of the everyday Some of us seek to create havens to shelter ourselves from the rigor of this work Well give ourselves over to an existential materialism seeking refuge not in the rigor of the truth of life as it is but in spiritual and psychological delusion Such havens are spawned when we convince ourselves that were done with inner exploration or we assure ourselves that the organizations weve created are havens of love safety and belonging never checking back though for fear that were wrong We need to be vigilant and rigorous in cutting through our delusions Such havens warned James Baldwin are highpriced They can demand of us that we live the unexamined delusional life I still believe that the unexamined life is not worth living and I know that selfdelusion wrote Baldwin in service of no matter what small or lofty cause is a price no writer can afford No writer Ill add no leader and finally no adult Paraphrasing Baldwin Id say that a leaders subject is himself and the world and it requires every ounce of stamina he can summon to attempt to look on himself and the world as they are Seeing ourselves and the world as they are is a cornerstone of good leadership and the welllived adulthood One of the most startling challenges I will put to a client comes from my bastardization of a Zen aphorism This being so so what Things being as they are what will you do about it Avoiding havens of selfdelusion maturing with a fierce regard for the truth of who and how we are allows us the grace and freedom to live with contradictory confusing and ambivalent feelings Dr Sayres taught me that one of the hallmarks of mental health is the ability to hold conflicting feelings Acknowledging that we hold those contradictions accepting that we can both love and hate precisely the same things is core to accepting ourselves all the way down to our bones Contradiction and ambivalence then are not further evidence of our failings We so fear being labeled hypocrites that we cast about for masks lest people see our ambivalence as weakness Just as we as adult humans can both love and hate we as human leaders can be both terrified and excited by the future The leader fears failure and yet believes in the teams potential to succeed Parents fret over their childens skinned knees and broken hearts but celebrate their separation and individuation Partners allow the space for both love and fear in the relationship trusting that the irrational messiness of their vulnerable and real selves will be wholly unfailingly and lovingly accepted In doing so in accepting that within themselves they create a true haven whereby their person their Other can be wholly fully their messy selves trusting that they too will be lovingly accepted Stepping out of such havens we are called upon to be loved to be made safe and to know that we belong not despite our failings but with compassionate regard for the gifts of our imperfections Leading and living in this unsheltered way invite us to take our seats as the most caring most calm voice in the roomin our relationships our families our companies and our communities My cofounder Ali Schultz taught me the wisdom of horses Horses with their supernatural ability to use their limbic nervous systems to discern truth and congruency do not base their choice of the leader of their herd on strength or intellectual wisdom Nor is their choice based on which member might keep the herd safe from a predator wolf They choose the one who feels the group best and who cares the most They choose the horse usually a marewho is most capable of holding that care in a way that calms the whole group Theyre marked by the attunement to the inner and outer needs of those they have the honor to serve and lead When leaders allow themselves the grace of being fierce with the reality of their messy brokenopen heartsthe truth of life as it is and not as they wish it to bethe individuals in the group are offered the opportunity as are our loved ones to let go of their fears of failing or disappointing and focus on the business at hand the worthiness of the shared task as well as the personal tasks of growing up and into their fullest potential as humans This being fierce with the reality of what is requires the bravery to ask of oneself three challenging and yet powerfully liberating questions What am I not saying that needs to be said What am I saying in words or deeds thats not being heard Whats being said that Im not hearing Dr Sayres taught me those questions to release me from the grip of my psychosomatic migraines In doing so she gave meand all those with whom Ive now workedthe gift of prajna My New York office is decorated with soothing blues and photographs taken from the various wondrous places Ive visited My main chair the seat I take when Im coaching is placed opposite a couch and under a photo from game one of the 2000 World Series when my beloved Yankees defeated the Mets Most clients will sit on the couch and I can emotionally hold them while we do the work Out of their sight and well within my view is a statue of Manjushri one of the oldest of the many Buddhist bodhisattvas My golden Manjushri wields a flaming sword representing the transcendent wisdom that cuts down ignorance duality and delusion What am I not saying Whats really going on What confusing and contradictory emotions are blocking our insight and wisdom to know the way forward The leader best able to cut through the miasma of confused and conflicting emotions to answer such questions and see the nature of the reality of the organizations triumphs and struggles is best able to calm and care for the herd But wielding the flaming sword demands that we do our work now and forever Finding Your Way I came to explore the wreck wrote poet Adrienne Rich in Diving into the Wreck not the story of the wreck the thing itself and not the myth We dive into the wreck make our way to the back of the cave to retrieve the treasure We use our words as Rich says as maps to our purpose Our radically inquisitive questions are spades A leaders work now and forever is to turn the muck of the ocean bottom and find the way Dr Sayress questions gave me courage while honoring my cowardice mapping my purpose and my way Here are your spades questions to ask yourself so that you might reboot your leadership and move forward on your journey of growing up How would I act were I to remember who I am What choices would I make what actions would I take if I regularly said the things that needed to be said Who would I become were I to be fully completely and wholly heard What is it that I wish the people in my life understood about me Who would I be without the myths Ive told about myself the stories that took hold when I was yearning to feel love safety and belonging First having turned that muck we then create the embodiment of our wishes and dreams our organizations our communities our society So often Im called in to help lead conversations about mission value and purpose When really the only questions that matter are those that tell us who we are and wish to be How would our organization respond were we to hear all the things that are being said regardless if they are being said with words or deeds What does it mean to be a leader at our organization What does it mean to be grown a fully actualized adult How would we feel if our children were to work for the company weve created or the team we lead How has the unsorted baggage of what has happened to us shaped who we are as leaders When our employees and colleagues leave our sides and our company what do we want them to say about our time together What do we believe to be true about the world What do we as a community of people working toward a common goal believe the world needs Regardless of the myths we are telling ourselves what kind of company or organization are we truly building At the end of our days are we becoming the person wed like to be A great guiding point to that question is yet another question What kind of adults do I want my children to be or become Whoever that might be we must be that person now to map out the path of becoming that will help them in their time to do their work and retrieve their sunken treasure Parker and I had one of our epic conversations in which we laughed as much as we spoke We came to realize that the only answer to the existential question of Does my life have meaning is again another set of questions In what ways have I been brave And How have I been kind Only by standing still asking ourselves such questions and listening to the answers will we finally find the warriorleader within Only then do we get to grow up and become the adults that are our birthright and responsibility If we stand still we may not like what we hear We may be frightened by what our soul tells us I dont want to be CEO I dont want this life Im meant for something or someone else Asking ourselves such open honest questions takes courage for the answers may frighten us challenging our working belief systems If we hear answers that surprise confuse and upset us well have to confront a terrifying followon question Now what do I do My friend Al Doan the cofounder of the Missouri Star Quilt Company stood still turned over the muck and decided to leave his job as CEO A few months later he met Drea They were married a year later Months after our rooftop beer toast Chad and I sat still and silent The pause in our conversation was lovely deep nourishing Side by side we watched his young son push a toy bulldozer through a sand pile at a Brooklyn playground and turned the soil of his transition out of Etsy We laughed at his decreased need to vomit as a result of the stomachchurning rollercoaster ride of being a CEO We laughed at the imagined fears of postCEO life We relished his relaxed ways and his ability to appreciate the slant of light the smell of the rain and the joy in hearing his sons delighted squealLook Dad lookat some suddenly revealed magic He then turned quiet and thoughtful as his son buried my hand in the sand of an imagined construction site Chad turned to me with a realization of the true nature of postCEO life Ya know he said with a chuckle and a shake of his head once youre a leader youre always a leader You kinda have no choice You cant put it back in the box And I guess once youre a warrior I laugh in response youre always a warrior You dont really have a choice about that either As I write these words Chad has sent me text messages He and his family are headed out for a longwishedfor crosscountry drive All my new life infrastructure is working well he wrote Sleeping well have a great doctor finances are humming etc Feeling good Xoxo This is how life is supposed to be I wrote back This is what your son needs from his dad Enjoy it Even if you dont always act like it I realize once youre an adult youre always an adult As I close out this chapter I swap stories and oldman remembrances with my friend Steve Kane I ask him Did you ever regret not taking Gamesville public Not really he tells me All my cofounders and I ever aspired to was to create a great business where we could have stimulating enjoyable work for ourselves and our staff and make a great living Good work done well for the right reasons We were entrepreneurs when all that meant was being lonely and scared and very different from everybody else we knew he continues Those folks were busy working their way to success and prosperity climbing up various ladders not risking it all on some ambitious but super risky idea He adds We just wanted to be our own bosses and make a great living Most of us will spend our days in some sort of work All of us lucky enough to be healthy will grow older Those two realities give us a tremendous opportunity use the work we need to perform to keep ourselves safe to grow into the adults we were born to be The greatest gifts of leadership are its challenge to remember who we are and the opportunity to become the grownups we were meant to be An Artist of My Days For me this has meant integrating words into my daily life For the man I am meant to be is someone who understands the liberating power of words others as well as mine This awareness began as so much of my growth began during long stretches of alone time In this case it was while I would take the subway from my home in Queens to my high school in Brooklyn I started high school while we still lived in Brooklyn Then in the middle of ninth grade my freshman year and following a fight between my parents my mother and I moved to Queens while my father and two of my brothers stayed back in Brooklyn Technically I violated the rules as my high school was zoned only for those kids who lived in Brooklyn But with all the disruption in my life caused by my parents separation I didnt want to change schools as well Whats more we were never sure how long this separation was going to last Like many other aspects of our family life it wasnt really discussed One day a few months later my father and my brothers simply moved in with us That move changed my life I began spending three hours a day commuting most often alone To pass the time I would do my homework and Id read I first began reading The Lord of the Rings on the A train from Lefferts Boulevard to Jay Street in downtown Brooklyn I escaped the pressures of the subway home and the stress of the commute and found a haven in Middleearth I found comfort in other worlds By reading closely I discovered that all writerswhether they were writing about Frodo taking his seat as a broken openhearted warrior at the gates of Mordor or how Zorba the Greek melted into the grief of his young sons death by dancing until his heart could cry no more or how the mysterious unnamed Invisible Man savored the sweetness of a hotbuttered yam on the streets of Harlem or how a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo would grow into a young man and artist named Stephen Daedaluswere essentially telling the same story their own While reading others words I began to discover my own I remember once holding on to the train car pole as the A train swayed sickeningly reading of the twisted interplay between Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov in Crime and Punishment I was nauseated by Raskolnikovs struggles with his overwhelming guilt and his burning hatred for his foil his counterpart I was so overcome with nausea that I had to grab the first seat available I put the book away and took out a blackandwhite marble composition book and began writing That was the beginning of a lifetime of journaling That was the beginning of finding my words This dance between the words of others and words of my own deepened over the next few years Early on in my commuting years I learned to hack my journey I shaved twenty minutes off the long commute by exiting the subway the A train at Jay Street going above ground and walking a few blocks to the Lawrence Street station to get to the M train I used my subway passsomething that enabled all students to ride the subways for freeto switch to the M train the M bound for Coney Island which would take me to the station closest to my high school Technically this was a violation as the pass was to be used only at my school and home stations but that would have required riding the A into Manhattan where I could switch to the M while remaining underground My little hack created the conditions for yet another asteroid to hit me Each day as I made my way from Jay to Lawrence Id pass Binkins Books One day I couldnt contain myself and I wandered in Mr Binkin sat wheezing behind a cash register and a pile of books And there were books everywhere Piles and piles of books Dirty dusty musty books I was in heaven Id found another haven Id visit Binkins every day Id wander the aisles Every now and then someone would come in and ask Mr Binkin if he had a certain book I have no idea hed growl between wheezes Go find it yourself Most folks would storm out One day I sat in the corner my backpack at my feet I had a boxed edition of Ivanhoe on my lap and was scribbling in my composition book my journal Suddenly Mr Binkin came from behind his counter shuffling and wheezing as he squeezed his considerable bulk past the musty piles He tossed a book into my lap Here youll like this We had never spoken more than a word or twousually just him telling me how much he was charging me for some tattered book I held at the counter I think the most frequent thing I heard him say was Fifty cent I looked down at my lap and there was a tattered copy of Call It Sleep by Henry Roth Even then I knew that no matter how much I identified with him I wasnt David Schearl the main protagonist The facts of our lives were just too different But the feelings of our lives mirrored each others Later when I was a man I came to understand Roths story and the poignant painful story of his novel having been forgotten for decades only to have been discovered in a remainder rack by a literary critic Long after Roth had traded the life of an author for the life of a Maine woodsman and duck farmer he remembered who he was rediscovered his words and overcame his wordlessness The twin asteroids of Binkins and Call It Sleep helped me begin to find my words For in my youngest days I felt wordless and that wordlessness led me to try to end my life In retrospect that attemptat eighteen wasnt merely a cryingout as folks are wont to say but a desperate attempt to speak to cut through to say what it was that needed saying Perhaps the trajectory of my leadership journey has been simply about learning to find the words When I was a reporter I looked to say what needed to be said about the world as I was experiencing it Later as an investor it was my ability to clearly see the world that was emerging as well as the warriors within the entrepreneurs seeking funding that led me to whatever financial success and approbation I enjoyed Writing coaching teaching being present serving othersthis is what I was meant to do I am becoming the man I was meant to be When I fail to live into that truth as I assuredly and frequently do Im heeding the worn out admonitions of my Loyal Soldiers and living from my shadow Part of my trajectory has been learning to accept my frailties shortcomings and the myriad clever insidious ways I act out the parts of me Id rather not see Writing notes the poet Terry Tempest Williams requires an aching curiosity leading you to discover uncover what is gnawing at your bones Retrieving those parts of me uncovering whats been gnawing at my bones has allowed me to find a source of strength wisdom and creativity As I become more cognizant of the parts of me about which I can feel shame I am more willing to admit to myself that I fail time and again to live up to the best aspirations and as a result my sense of spirit and worthiness grows My great guide the beloved poet John ODonohue reminds us Each of us is an artist of our days The greater our integrity and awareness the more original and creative our time will become Whatever the originality and creativity whatever the leadership and adult wisdom that I carry stem from the lessons Ive learned from those who have come before me For when Im reading Im uncovering the truths they discovered When Im journaling Im discovering my own truth When Im writing Im speaking the truths that come from the synthesis of the truth of others and my own words my own truth To be a good leader Ive had to learn to be as honest as I could facing down the shameproducing caws of the Crow To be a good leader and a good writer has meant learning to be an honest nondeluded adult To be a good writer I must be an honest man Building Castles Slaying Dragons and Rebooting Me I cant think of a sadder way to die than with the knowledge that I never showed up in this world as who I really am I cant think of a more graced way to die than with the knowledge that I showed up here as my true self the best I knew how able to engage life freely and lovingly because I had become fierce with reality Parker Palmer On the Brink of Everything Why are you so obsessed with this good man thing Ali asked her voice tinged with a mix of fear and frustration She was tired of my groundlessness Perhaps she saw in me what I often fail to see and so is upset by the stories I tell about myself and the questions that plague me What is a good man Have I been a good father Do I even have a superpower Am I the impostor the Crow tells me I am I turn over these questions repeatedly A good man takes care answers a voice in my head that of my father perhaps or my Grandpa Guido A good man as Ive been repeating lately builds castles slays dragons and if hes opened his heart tends the hearth building a fire against the cold empty night so that his loved ones are safe warm and happy Handbuilt castles and slain dragons give those he loves safety and belonging On a walk on a hill in Marin thankful for the gift that is California I met an ancient tree toppled by age blight and wind Stopping in my tracks I realized Here lies a good man If at the end of my days as this current meat bag starts its inevitable transition to the Earth that birthed me I can lie as majestically about the soil as this elder Ill know that I earned my manhood His body ragged with the scars of actions he may not always have been proud of but resting in the knowledge that for fifty sixty or one hundred years he grew into his purpose sheltering others providing them a respite from the glaring sun the toppling wind and the painful vagaries of life Gnarled and twisted by inaction decisions taken and not taken scarred by selfishness with limbs stretched by acts of kindness generosity and gentleness I wish to end my days stretched out on the side of a hill welcoming the slow decomposition of my anxieties and my flesh into nourishing earth Years ago I had an epic dreamthe kind that teaches you about yourself I had returned to a past job the place where I became an adult and a father Working this gift from my innermost being I found myself articulating fiercely my purpose to serve others in their pursuit of their own becoming To do that Ive modeled myself after my teachers stepping into their giant impactful footsteps they who taught me that the way to guide is to ask and not to tell Theres an indescribable power in a wellasked question questions that are openended and honest honest in that I couldnt know the answer allow my clients souls to speak When they ask me how to be a better leader Ill often ask them to tell me what they think it means to lead well How should I build my company is met with What kind of company do you want to work for I know I frustrate them Like my being frustrated by Ani Pema Chdrns advice to follow the pathless path I know they simply want answers And beyond sharing my observations about my own journey and my own lessons learned all I can offer is questions What kind of leader are you Tell us and teachers will guide you reflecting when youre leading with congruency For me Im a leader who relies on the power of words to convey meaning and purpose to find the empathy that allows a team to coalesce and cohere Tell me what success and failure mean for you and we can use your answers to chart a path Tell me if after imagining your children working for your company you feel shame fear or pride and Ill tell you if youre building a worthwhile company What do you believe about the world Is the world a harsh dogeatdog world or is it despite its obvious failings a lifegiving generative gift from the divine What do you believe about people Are they out to optimize only for themselves or are they simply stalled blocked by the ghosts in their machines waiting to be led to a place of full actualization full growth into warrior adulthood Back on that hill in Marin the toppled tree brings me back to the chestnut tree of my childhoodmy friend my sanctuary I weep at the comparison This gnarled oak got to live out its days while my friend ended in a pile of sawn logs and dust At its base near where the massive root system had been ripped from the earth irises were sprouting I want then to be reborn with the bright promise of young irises A good man a good leader a warrior a grownup takes pride in his aspirations without using failure to achieve those aspirations as evidence of his unworthiness his unlovability He also gives that to his children his loved ones his partners his friends his colleagues and all those whom he encounters I think again of my proofreader dads Parker pen the one hed use to complete the puzzles in the Daily News the one hed use to correct the typos in the paper the one that never left his side I loved that pen for I saw in it an instrument of his care and his efforts to be a good man Abandoned as a baby and given over for adoption he like my mother did the best he could I think of Moms weekly deposits to her Christmas club savings accounta dollar here five dollars theresaving and saving so that come Christmas she could buy us the toys that would make us squeal with delight One of the sweetest most joyful memories of my life is of my brothers Dom John and me tearing the wrapping off our matching aluminum suitcasestyle play sets Dom got the Viking set John the frontier fort and I got the miniature spacetravel launch center with real rockets that sent astronauts to the moon and exploring asteroids and shooting stars Mom and Dad were of course both toppled by age and illness their bodies hearts and minds bore the scars and twisted limbs of the vagaries of life Those two may have been gnarled and twisted by their fears and the violence of the abandonment and anger of those who came before them but their limbs were also stretched by acts of kindness generosity and the tremendous courage and will to do right by their children and grandchildren A few weeks before my son Michael was to turn twentyone he and I sat down at a table He stared off into the backyard of what was the home in which he and his brother Sam and sister Emma had come of age Staring off we spoke of the fearful potential of his life The awful and awefilled possibilities as he imagined his future life with his college years ending and the rest of his years beginning He laughed when I shared the title of Parkers latest book On the Brink of Everything Thats it he said Thats exactly how I feel Parker writing about life from the vantage point of his late seventies had spoken to a young man a good man in his early twenties On the brink of everything and facing the future with fear tenacity excitement and curiosity This is how we grow Irises sprouting at the base of the toppledover sage tree one whos served the world well and is taking his deserved rest dying in such a graced way Becoming Me My pursuit of lemon drops and Monopoly money had left me wealthy but empty When I was circling the street above the stinking smoking hole of Ground Zero I hadnt yet put to rest the ghosts in the machine of my childhood Money in my pocket did little to quiet the lingering shame and guilt I felt watching my father blow air into an empty wallet when I asked for the funds to apply to college No matter the success I had no matter the headlines I garnered I couldnt quiet the warnings of my Loyal Soldier who whispered the misplaced childlike logic that to save myself I had to deplete myself that to belong to be safe to be loved I had to die I was trapped by this logic It seemed that the only way to earn what I had the only way to earn itthe approbations the lemon drops the safety I sought the right to see myself as an adult a good manwas to give and give like the fairytale gingerbread man being eaten by the fox Im a quarter gone Im half gone Im threequarters gone Im all gone But the rebooting of my internal systems helped me understand that the world isnt a fox out to eat us The world doesnt really want to harm us at all It may wish to shape us to change us into something other than who we were born to be It will give us facile playbooks on how to be a leader Itll give us subtle and gross signs that we are not what it needs us to be But it isnt out to eat us It merely wants from us the ability to fill the hole in its chest Like each of us our colleagues our lovers our friends all want love safety and belonging They merely unconsciously see in us the potential to meet that need So we become the objects of their projections the screen onto which they project their own shadows Wanting to belong we cooperate We become our employees disapproving parent the foil in their comedy act the funhouse mirror reflecting the view of them they want to see the partner against whom they struggle so that they can grow We become their Irrational Other so they can stumble skin their knees and find their own way In this way the world can ask us to give more and more until theres less and less of us Perversely then we are often rewarded for our complicity in this dance Lemon drops and the envy of others can be ours for the taking The world affirmed me for giving more and more for allowing my hair to catch and remain on fire for giving and giving until I became the gingerbread man I gave because I wanted to belong But the more I gave the more I lost And the more lost I became Yet we are more than the ghosts in our machines We can stand still power down reboot the systems and disrupt the programing We need to have the courage to be truthful and break through our delusions and accept the this being so of life I will always be haunted by lemon drops sawdust and the power of words I am grateful this is so Out of such pain such suffering and the muck and mud of my ocean bottom a tall strong tree of a man has emerged I overcame the wordlessness of my youth I became a good man by learning to love wordsfirst those of others then later my own words I became who I was born to be by learning to read and then later to write I learned that a life well written is a life well led I became a good leader and Im still becoming a good man That is my legacy the wisdom of knowing that the act of becoming a good man is more important than arriving at that place With that Ive begun mastering the art of growing up Journaling Invitations How will I know my work is done Afterword A Light Heart Lives Long As this book came alive lifes roller coaster continued unabated In the just more than a year since I began writing one friend married the love of his life while two others divorced The parents grandparents children and spouses of various friends all struggled with illness and death For example as I was finding my way to my words my brother Vito was temporarily silenced with painful throat cancer When we were very young Vito had introduced me and my brothers John and Dom to Winniethe Pooh Dom John and I would climb over and around my big brothers lap laughing as Vito read of Pooh knowing no other way to come down the stairs than upside down and with his head banging on each step silly old bear We laughed with the love safety and belonging of our snuggling in our big brothers lap Now decades later as I write these words on a crisp September morning Vito has rediscovered his words he emails the family The doctor says Im cancer free In March 2018 I flew to California My plane landed and my phone buzzed with news Id been dreading for close to a year Dr Sayres had died As the plane made its way over the tarmac to the gate as the other passengers gathered their belongings I sat still I wept Grief washed over me she who is so present in this work I thought will never know the completed book Around the same time I was seated at a conference table at my doctors office when the young internist came in to review the scan of my heart If it were me he said with his Adams apple bobbing Id get a stent preferably as soon as possible With that shock coursing through my body I boarded a plane to spend the weekend in Providence visiting my son Michael at school The doctors words haunted me the whole of the flight If it were me Id get a stent The next day Michael and I strolled Thayer Street stopping at the Brown University bookstore I was still clouded with shock grief and fear At the checkout counter as I paid for a copy of Marie Ponsots latest collection of poetry and for Michael a copy of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man I caught sight of a tiny button with black lettering on a white field A LIGHT HEART LIVES LONG I stood next to one of my childrensource of the fierce calling to be my most adult selfand wept once more This time though I wept at the wonderful synchronicity of life In the months since I opened myself to writing this book an excavation of the relationship between leadership and the act of becoming an adult my heart has been broken several times With a cardiologists blessing I chose not to get the stent My writing became my stent keeping the arteries of my broken heart open My words like my blood flowed freely A light heart that lives long is one that has learned to appreciate the roller coaster from the ground to see that the point of it all is to know that life simply goes on And as my father once joked the alternative to life not going on isnt that great The synchronicity wasnt manifested in my finding a button with a message I needed to hear at precisely the moment I needed to hear it The synchronicity lay in the testing of my core thesis precisely as I was writing that thesis It was as if life itself were asking me if I truly believed my own simple assertion about life and leadership What better way for the universe to test my beliefthat better humans make better leadersthan to send me on a rollercoaster ride of heartbreak challenging me to be a better human For the patterns we developed to keep ourselves from feeling suffering and the pain of broken hearts are what hold each of us back from being our most adult selves the best leaders possible I had to stand still and show up fully and keep showing up despite my butt being kicked and my heart being broken To speak of such things without being willing to reveal your own actualization your own journey to adulthood would be hollow and empty I wrote in the introduction Hollow and empty would not suffice That remained true even as my butt was kicked and my heart ached Sharon Salzberg my mogul of lovingkindness bore witness to the butt kicking As the great teacher that she is Sharon helped me see that all things were workable Every bit of the experienceevery joy and every vomitinducing drop on the roller coasteris an opportunity to practice and to grow I honor her teachings when I remember that the art of growing up includes the practice of remembering that all beings are basically good Such remembering the late poet John ODonohue reminds us is an essential element of adult leadership When someone fails or disappoints you he writes May the graciousness with which you engage Be their stairway to renewal and refinement All things are workable Every dip and rise of the roller coaster every instance of heartbreak and life unfolding are opportunities for that radical inquiry within In this way we turn the experience of being a leader into the journey into adulthood In this way says ODonohue leadership becomes a true adventure of growth The goal of this book was to act on you as a coaching session might The goal was to give you something more useful than answers the ability to work with the questions the uncertainties and the doubts that spring from the dips in life To show you that you could arrive at your own answers answers that would be authentic and true to you At some point you may find doubts arising At some point if youre at all like the rest of us you may ask yourself if youre even able to participate in that true adventure of growth If so know that the answer is a resounding yes But theres a catch Its yes but only if youre willing to put your head up to the mouth of the demon In this case the demon is the underlying lack of belief in your capacity to lead The demons teeth are powerful questions the answers to which frighten and startle you accelerating your growth This path to adult leadership demands that such fearful questions are answered fearlessly To do this we notice our responses with discerning inquiry and without judgment to the questions that arise Inquiring this way isnt as some may fear a form of indulgent navel gazing but a fearsome first step in the resolution to grow Indeed therein lies another opportunity for leadership growth What might my reluctance about looking inward say about the protective patterns of my life How might such a reticence be shaping my organization and our ability to consider alternative possibilities What do the ghosts in my machine tell me about the risks posed by opening myself or standing firm while others open themselves What do those ghosts need to hear to finally rest in peace Theres a tradition in Buddhism of dedicating the merit of any effort we undertake In this way we believe all actions may be of service to others In honor of that tradition may whatever merit my effort has generated be of service to you Moreover may the merit generated by your seeking answers to powerful open and honest questions about your life and your leadership be of service to those you lead In the end if Ive managed to convince you that better humans make better leaders then your open honest questions are simple What is my work to do to become a better human What kind of leader am I And finally What kind of adult am I meant to be Authors Note Heres to the imperfection of memory Heres to the way we fiction and fable our lives as the poet Pdraig Tuama says in order to tell of things that are more than true To complete this work to show up in a way that is not hollow and empty I had to tap the wellspring of my imperfect and fabling memory How many stitches did I get at the top of my head after I slipped walking down the steps into our house while wearing my roller skates Was it six or sixteen times that the needle went into my skin at the top of my skull Was the bike I received at eight in celebration of my First Holy Communion red or purple The imperfection of remembering past things is often coupled with the need to fiction and fable I tried to meet this need and to do well by mixing composite and real named characters For to live well notes my friend Pdraig is to see wisely and to see wisely is to tell stories Indeed some folks stories have been disguised while others have been left out In fact there were far more folks absented than included The many partners cofounders significant others and family members have been left out not out of malice but simply by my best judgment The times and places of events have been altered in ways to support the underlying message to support the demand to say the morethantrue things The result is a collection of stories made visceral by my imperfect memories and observations I am after all Holder of Stories of the Heart and we are a tribe of warriors sitting around a campfire using tales to make sense of an insensible world There are those folks whose lives I touch upon who surely have different feelings observations and perceptions Such different views are no less true or valid than my own While the facts remembered by others may be different our feelings are doubtlessly similar maybe even more than true The wise elders in my life encouraged me to honor such different feelings such different truths as I honor my own Ive tried to use my truth to advance an understanding of the world as Ive come to see it Whats required of each of us I believe is to speak truth while releasing ourselves from the obligation to share the whole truth This said and for what its worth the bike was purple and it had a great banana seat Acknowledgments Many authors acknowledge the people in their lives who helped make their book a reality When I read that a book would not have been possible were it not for the acknowledged folks Id always assumed such statements were merely polite hyperbole Then I wrote my own book Now I know what those writers felt For example this book benefitted from the support and patience of Ali Schultz Ali you supported me through each word of every draft You patiently listened to me read aloud passage after passage encouraging me as Id edit on the fly Far too many Sundayevening dinners were spent with my frustrated declarations of utter incompetence after a weekend of vain attempts to write You stared me down and brooked no nonsense when Id lament that I was never going to finish that I was a fool for even trying and that I should just send back the advance You pushed me forward when my Crow squawked his loudest Indeed youve always seen the good in me especially when my fears caused me to see only my failings Even today you continue to tether me keeping me grounded to the reality of who I am and the good work I do and when I am lost and wishing for nothing more than to disappear into the crack of the tree you show me the way home Thank you for being my map and my anchor Dear Sam Emma and Michael Of all the things Ive done in my life nothing compares to the experience of being your father It is a gift that grows in

Alchemist Paulo Coelho Translated by Alan R Clarke Published 1992 ISBN 0722532938 PART ONE The boys name was Santiago Dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church The roof had fallen in long ago and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the sacristy had once stood He decided to spend the night there He saw to it that all the sheep entered through the ruined gate and then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night There were no wolves in the region but once an animal had strayed during the night and the boy had had to spend the entire next day searching for it He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down using the book he had just finished reading as a pillow He told himself that he would have to start reading thicker books they lasted longer and made more comfortable pillows It was still dark when he awoke and looking up he could see the stars through the halfdestroyed roof I wanted to sleep a little longer he thought He had had the same dream that night as a week ago and once again he had awakened before it ended He arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept He had noticed that as soon as he awoke most of his animals also began to stir It was as if some mysterious energy bound his life to that of the sheep with whom he had spent the past two years leading them through the countryside in search of food and water They are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered Thinking about that for a moment he realized that it could be the other way around that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken The boy prodded them one by one with his crook calling each by name He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said So there were times when he read them parts of his books that had made an impression on him or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing the girl the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village they would reach in about four days He had been to the village only once the year before The merchant was the proprietor of a dry goods shop and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in his presence so that he would not be cheated A friend had told the boy about the shop and he had taken his sheep there I need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant The shop was busy and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from his bag I didnt know shepherds knew how to read said a girls voice behind him The girl was typical of the region of Andalusia with flowing black hair and eyes that vaguely recalled the Moorish conquerors Well usually I learn more from my sheep than from books he answered During the two hours that they talked she told him she was the merchants daughter and spoke of life in the village where each day was like all the others The shepherd told her of the Andalusian countryside and related the news from the other towns where he had stopped It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep How did you learn to read the girl asked at one point Like everybody learns he said In school Well if you know how to read why are you just a shepherd The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question He was sure the girl would never understand He went on telling stories about his travels and her bright Moorish eyes went wide with fear and surprise As the time passed the boy found himself wishing that the day would never end that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before the desire to live in one place forever With the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again But finally the merchant appeared and asked the boy to shear four sheep He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year And now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village He was excited and at the same time uneasy maybe the girl had already forgotten him Lots of shepherds passed through selling their wool It doesnt matter he said to his sheep I know other girls in other places But in his heart he knew that it did matter And he knew that shepherds like seamen and like traveling salesmen always found a town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering The day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun They never have to make any decisions he thought Maybe thats why they always stay close to me The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water As long as the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia they would be his friends Yes their days were all the same with the seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk and they had never read a book in their young lives and didnt understand when the boy told them about the sights of the cities They were content with just food and water and in exchange they generously gave of their wool their company andonce in a while their meat If I became a monster today and decided to kill them one by one they would become aware only after most of the flock had been slaughtered thought the boy They trust me and theyve forgotten how to rely on their own instincts because I lead them to nourishment The boy was surprised at his thoughts Maybe the church with the sycamore growing from within had been haunted It had caused him to have the same dream for a second time and it was causing him to feel anger toward his faithful companions He drank a bit from the wine that remained from his dinner of the night before and he gathered his jacket closer to his body He knew that a few hours from now with the sun at its zenith the heat would be so great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer The heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket But when he thought to complain about the burden of its weight he remembered that because he had the jacket he had withstood the cold of the dawn We have to be prepared for change he thought and he was grateful for the jackets weight and warmth The jacket had a purpose and so did the boy His purpose in life was to travel and after two years of walking the Andalusian terrain he knew all the cities of the region He was planning on this visit to explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen His parents had wanted him to become a priest and thereby a source of pride for a simple farm family They worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep He had studied Latin Spanish and theology But ever since he had been a child he had wanted to know the world and this was much more important to him than knowing God and learning about mans sins One afternoon on a visit to his family he had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he didnt want to become a priest That he wanted to travel People from all over the world have passed through this village son said his father They come in search of new things but when they leave they are basically the same people they were when they arrived They climb the mountain to see the castle and they wind up thinking that the past was better than what we have now They have blond hair or dark skin but basically theyre the same as the people who live right here But Id like to see the castles in the towns where they live the boy explained Those people when they see our land say that they would like to live here forever his father continued Well Id like to see their land and see how they live said his son The people who come here have a lot of money to spend so they can afford to travel his father said Amongst us the only ones who travel are the shepherds Well then Ill be a shepherd His father said no more The next day he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient Spanish gold coins I found these one day in the fields I wanted them to be a part of your inheritance But use them to buy your flock Take to the fields and someday youll learn that our countryside is the best and our women the most beautiful And he gave the boy his blessing The boy could see in his fathers gaze a desire to be able himself to travel the worlda desire that was still alive despite his fathers having had to bury it over dozens of years under the burden of struggling for water to drink food to eat and the same place to sleep every night of his life The horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared The boy thought back to that conversation with his father and felt happy he had already seen many castles and met many women but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence He owned a jacket a book that he could trade for another and a flock of sheep But most important he was able every day to live out his dream If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields he could sell his sheep and go to sea By the time he had had enough of the sea he would already have known other cities other women and other chances to be happy I couldnt have found God in the seminary he thought as he looked at the sunrise Whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel He had never been to that ruined church before in spite of having traveled through those parts many times The world was huge and inexhaustible he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a while and he would discover other interesting things The problem is that they dont even realize that theyre walking a new road every day They dont see that the fields are new and the seasons change All they think about is food and water Maybe were all that way the boy mused Even meI havent thought of other women since I met the merchants daughter Looking at the sun he calculated that he would reach Tarifa before midday There he could exchange his book for a thicker one fill his wine bottle shave and have a haircut he had to prepare himself for his meeting with the girl and he didnt want to think about the possibility that some other shepherd with a larger flock of sheep had arrived there before him and asked for her hand Its the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting he thought as he looked again at the position of the sun and hurried his pace He had suddenly remembered that in Tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams The old woman led the boy to a room at the back of her house it was separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads The rooms furnishings consisted of a table an image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and two chairs The woman sat down and told him to be seated as well Then she took both of his hands in hers and began quietly to pray It sounded like a Gypsy prayer The boy had already had experience on the road with Gypsies they also traveled but they had no flocks of sheep People said that Gypsies spent their lives tricking others It was also said that they had a pact with the devil and that they kidnapped children and taking them away to their mysterious camps made them their slaves As a child the boy had always been frightened to death that he would be captured by Gypsies and this childhood fear returned when the old woman took his hands in hers But she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there he thought trying to reassure himself He didnt want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful He recited an Our Father silently Very interesting said the woman never taking her eyes from the boys hands and then she fell silent The boy was becoming nervous His hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it He quickly pulled his hands away I didnt come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come He thought for a moment that it would be better to pay her fee and leave without learning a thing that he was giving too much importance to his recurrent dream You came so that you could learn about your dreams said the old woman And dreams are the language of God When he speaks in our language I can interpret what he has said But if he speaks in the language of the soul it is only you who can understand But whichever it is Im going to charge you for the consultation Another trick the boy thought But he decided to take a chance A shepherd always takes his chances with wolves and with drought and thats what makes a shepherds life exciting I have had the same dream twice he said I dreamed that I was in a field with my sheep when a child appeared and began to play with the animals I dont like people to do that because the sheep are afraid of strangers But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them I dont know why I dont know how animals know the age of human beings Tell me more about your dream said the woman I have to get back to my cooking and since you dont have much money I cant give you a lot of time The child went on playing with my sheep for quite a while continued the boy a bit upset And suddenly the child took me by both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were But she said nothing Then at the Egyptian pyramidshe said the last three words slowly so that the old woman would understandthe child said to me If you come here you will find a hidden treasure And just as she was about to show me the exact location I woke up Both times The woman was silent for some time Then she again took his hands and studied them carefully Im not going to charge you anything now she said But I want onetenth of the treasure if you find it The boy laughedout of happiness He was going to be able to save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden treasure Well interpret the dream he said First swear to me Swear that you will give me onetenth of your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you The shepherd swore that he would The old woman asked him to swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus Its a dream in the language of the world she said I can interpret it but the interpretation is very difficult Thats why I feel that I deserve a part of what you find And this is my interpretation you must go to the Pyramids in Egypt I have never heard of them but if it was a child who showed them to you they exist There you will find a treasure that will make you a rich man The boy was surprised and then irritated He didnt need to seek out the old woman for this But then he remembered that he wasnt going to have to pay anything I didnt need to waste my time just for this he said I told you that your dream was a difficult one Its the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary only wise men are able to understand them And since I am not wise I have had to learn other arts such as the reading of palms Well how am I going to get to Egypt I only interpret dreams I dont know how to turn them into reality Thats why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with And what if I never get to Egypt Then I dont get paid It wouldnt be the first time And the woman told the boy to leave saying she had already wasted too much time with him So the boy was disappointed he decided that he would never again believe in dreams He remembered that he had a number of things he had to take care of he went to the market for something to eat he traded his book for one that was thicker and he found a bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had bought The day was hot and the wine was refreshing The sheep were at the gates of the city in a stable that belonged to a friend The boy knew a lot of people in the city That was what made traveling appeal to himhe always made new friends and he didnt need to spend all of his time with them When someone sees the same people every day as had happened with him at the seminary they wind up becoming a part of that persons life And then they want the person to change If someone isnt what others want them to be the others become angry Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives but none about his or her own He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before following his flock back through the fields Three days from now he would be with the merchants daughter He started to read the book he had bought On the very first page it described a burial ceremony And the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce If he ever wrote a book he thought he would present one person at a time so that the reader wouldnt have to worry about memorizing a lot of names When he was finally able to concentrate on what he was reading he liked the book better the burial was on a snowy day and he welcomed the feeling of being cold As he read on an old man sat down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation What are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza Working the boy answered dryly making it look as if he wanted to concentrate on his reading Actually he was thinking about shearing his sheep in front of the merchants daughter so that she could see that he was someone who was capable of doing difficult things He had already imagined the scene many times every time the girl became fascinated when he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep Most of them he had read in books but he would tell them as if they were from his personal experience She would never know the difference because she didnt know how to read Meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation He said that he was tired and thirsty and asked if he might have a sip of the boys wine The boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone But the old man wanted to talk and he asked the boy what book he was reading The boy was tempted to be rude and move to another bench but his father had taught him to be respectful of the elderly So he held out the book to the manfor two reasons first that he himself wasnt sure how to pronounce the title and second that if the old man didnt know how to read he would probably feel ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches Hmm said the old man looking at all sides of the book as if it were some strange object This is an important book but its really irritating The boy was shocked The old man knew how to read and had already read the book And if the book was irritating as the old man had said the boy still had time to change it for another Its a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in the world say continued the old man It describes peoples inability to choose their own destinies And it ends up saying that everyone believes the worlds greatest lie Whats the worlds greatest lie the boy asked completely surprised Its this that at a certain point in our lives we lose control of whats happening to us and our lives become controlled by fate Thats the worlds greatest lie Thats never happened to me the boy said They wanted me to be a priest but I decided to become a shepherd Much better said the old man Because you really like to travel He knew what I was thinking the boy said to himself The old man meanwhile was leafing through the book without seeming to want to return it at all The boy noticed that the mans clothing was strange He looked like an Arab which was not unusual in those parts Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa one had only to cross the narrow straits by boat Arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day Where are you from the boy asked From many places No one can be from many places the boy said Im a shepherd and I have been to many places but I come from only one placefrom a city near an ancient castle Thats where I was born Well then we could say that I was born in Salem The boy didnt know where Salem was but he didnt want to ask fearing that he would appear ignorant He looked at the people in the plaza for a while they were coming and going and all of them seemed to be very busy So what is Salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue Its like it always has been No clue yet But he knew that Salem wasnt in Andalusia If it were he would already have heard of it And what do you do in Salem he insisted What do I do in Salem The old man laughed Well Im the king of Salem People say strange things the boy thought Sometimes its better to be with the sheep who dont say anything And better still to be alone with ones books They tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them But when youre talking to people they say some things that are so strange that you dont know how to continue the conversation My name is Melchizedek said the old man How many sheep do you have Enough said the boy He could see that the old man wanted to know more about his life Well then weve got a problem I cant help you if you feel youve got enough sheep The boy was getting irritated He wasnt asking for help It was the old man who had asked for a drink of his wine and had started the conversation Give me my book the boy said I have to go and gather my sheep and get going Give me onetenth of your sheep said the old man and Ill tell you how to find the hidden treasure The boy remembered his dream and suddenly everything was clear to him The old woman hadnt charged him anything but the old manmaybe he was her husbandwas going to find a way to get much more money in exchange for information about something that didnt even exist The old man was probably a Gypsy too But before the boy could say anything the old man leaned over picked up a stick and began to write in the sand of the plaza Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded With a movement that was too quick for someone his age the man covered whatever it was with his cape When his vision returned to normal the boy was able to read what the old man had written in the sand There in the sand of the plaza of that small city the boy read the names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he had attended He read the name of the merchants daughter which he hadnt even known and he read things he had never told anyone Im the king of Salem the old man had said Why would a king be talking with a shepherd the boy asked awed and embarrassed For several reasons But lets say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your destiny The boy didnt know what a persons destiny was Its what you have always wanted to accomplish Everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is At that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible They are not afraid to dream and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives But as time passes a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their destiny None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy But he wanted to know what the mysterious force was the merchants daughter would be impressed when he told her about that Its a force that appears to be negative but actually shows you how to realize your destiny It prepares your spirit and your will because there is one great truth on this planet whoever you are or whatever it is that you do when you really want something its because that desire originated in the soul of the universe Its your mission on earth Even when all you want to do is travel Or marry the daughter of a textile merchant Yes or even search for treasure The Soul of the World is nourished by peoples happiness And also by unhappiness envy and jealousy To realize ones destiny is a persons only real obligation All things are one And when you want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it They were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople It was the old man who spoke first Why do you tend a flock of sheep Because I like to travel The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at one corner of the plaza When he was a child that man wanted to travel too But he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside When hes an old man hes going to spend a month in Africa He never realized that people are capable at any time in their lives of doing what they dream of He should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said Well he thought about that the old man said But bakers are more important people than shepherds Bakers have homes while shepherds sleep out in the open Parents would rather see their children marry bakers than shepherds The boy felt a pang in his heart thinking about the merchants daughter There was surely a baker in her town The old man continued In the long run what people think about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own destinies The old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page he came to The boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted Why are you telling me all this Because you are trying to realize your destiny And you are at the point where youre about to give it all up And thats when you always appear on the scene Not always in this way but I always appear in one form or another Sometimes I appear in the form of a solution or a good idea At other times at a crucial moment I make it easier for things to happen There are other things I do too but most of the time people dont realize Ive done them The old man related that the week before he had been forced to appear before a miner and had taken the form of a stone The miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds For five years he had been working a certain river and had examined hundreds of thousands of stones looking for an emerald The miner was about to give it all up right at the point when if he were to examine just one more stonejust one morehe would find his emerald Since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved He transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miners foot The miner with all the anger and frustration of his five fruitless years picked up the stone and threw it aside But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone it fell upon and there embedded in the broken stone was the most beautiful emerald in the world People learn early in their lives what is their reason for being said the old man with a certain bitterness Maybe thats why they give up on it so early too But thats the way it is The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water and it is buried by the same currents said the old man If you want to learn about your own treasure you will have to give me one tenth of your flock What about onetenth of my treasure The old man looked disappointed If you start out by promising what you dont even have yet youll lose your desire to work toward getting it The boy told him that he had already promised to give onetenth of his treasure to the Gypsy Gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man In any case its good that youve learned that everything in life has its price This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach The old man returned the book to the boy Tomorrow at this same time bring me a tenth of your flock And I will tell you how to find the hidden treasure Good afternoon And he vanished around the corner of the plaza The boy began again to read his book but he was no longer able to concentrate He was tense and upset because he knew that the old man was right He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of bread thinking about whether or not he should tell the baker what the old man had said about him Sometimes its better to leave things as they are he thought to himself and decided to say nothing If he were to say anything the baker would spend three days thinking about giving it all up even though he had gotten used to the way things were The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker So he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates There was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to Africa And he knew that Egypt was in Africa Can I help you asked the man behind the window Maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away If he sold just one of his sheep hed have enough to get to the other shore of the strait The idea frightened him Another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away He doesnt have enough money to travel While standing at the ticket window the boy had remembered his flock and decided he should go back to being a shepherd In two years he had learned everything about shepherding he knew how to shear sheep how to care for pregnant ewes and how to protect the sheep from wolves He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals He decided to return to his friends stable by the longest route possible As he walked past the citys castle he interrupted his return and climbed the stone ramp that led to the top of the wall From there he could see Africa in the distance Someone had once told him that it was from there that the Moors had come to occupy all of Spain He could see almost the entire city from where he sat including the plaza where he had talked with the old man Curse the moment I met that old man he thought He had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream Neither the woman nor the old man were at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd They were solitary individuals who no longer believed in things and didnt understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep He knew everything about each member of his flock he knew which ones were lame which one was to give birth two months from now and which were the laziest He knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them If he ever decided to leave them they would suffer The wind began to pick up He knew that wind people called it the levanter because on it the Moors had come from the Levant at the eastern end of the Mediterranean The levanter increased in intensity Here I am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought He had to choose between something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted to have There was also the merchants daughter but she wasnt as important as his flock because she didnt depend on him Maybe she didnt even remember him He was sure that it made no difference to her on which day he appeared for her every day was the same and when each day is the same as the next its because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises I left my father my mother and the town castle behind They have gotten used to my being away and so have I The sheep will get used to my not being there too the boy thought From where he sat he could observe the plaza People continued to come and go from the bakers shop A young couple sat on the bench where he had talked with the old man and they kissed That baker he said to himself without completing the thought The levanter was still getting stronger and he felt its force on his face That wind had brought the Moors yes but it had also brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search for the unknown and for gold and adventure and for the Pyramids The boy felt jealous of the freedom of the wind and saw that he could have the same freedom There was nothing to hold him back except himself The sheep the merchants daughter and the fields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his destiny The next day the boy met the old man at noon He brought six sheep with him Im surprised the boy said My friend bought all the other sheep immediately He said that he had always dreamed of being a shepherd and that it was a good omen Thats the way it always is said the old man Its called the principle of favorability When you play cards the first time you are almost sure to win Beginners luck Why is that Because there is a force that wants you to realize your destiny it whets your appetite with a taste of success Then the old man began to inspect the sheep and he saw that one was lame The boy explained that it wasnt important since that sheep was the most intelligent of the flock and produced the most wool Where is the treasure he asked Its in Egypt near the Pyramids The boy was startled The old woman had said the same thing But she hadnt charged him anything In order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens God has prepared a path for everyone to follow You just have to read the omens that he left for you Before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man He remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen Like crickets and like expectations like lizards and fourleaf clovers Thats right said the old man able to read the boys thoughts Just as your grandfather taught you These are good omens The old man opened his cape and the boy was struck by what he saw The old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day He really was a king He must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves Take these said the old man holding out a white stone and a black stone that had been embedded at the center of the breastplate They are called Urim and Thummim The black signifies yes and the white no When you are unable to read the omens they will help you to do so Always ask an objective question But if you can try to make your own decisions The treasure is at the Pyramids that you already knew But I had to insist on the payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision The boy put the stones in his pouch From then on he would make his own decisions Dont forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing else And dont forget the language of omens And above all dont forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion But before I go I want to tell you a little story A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of happiness from the wisest man in the world The lad wandered through the desert for forty days and finally came upon a beautiful castle high atop a mountain It was there that the wise man lived Rather than finding a saintly man though our hero on entering the main room of the castle saw a hive of activity tradesmen came and went people were conversing in the corners a small orchestra was playing soft music and there was a table covered with platters of the most delicious food in that part of the world The wise man conversed with everyone and the boy had to wait for two hours before it was his turn to be given the mans attention The wise man listened attentively to the boys explanation of why he had come but told him that he didnt have time just then to explain the secret of happiness He suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours Meanwhile I want to ask you to do something said the wise man handing the boy a teaspoon that held two drops of oil As you wander around carry this spoon with you without allowing the oill to spill The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of the palace keeping his eyes fixed on the spoon After two hours he returned to the room where the wise man was Well asked the wise man did you see the Persian tapestries that are hanging in my dining hall Did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my library The boy was embarrassed and confessed that he had observed nothing His only concern had been not to spill the oill that the wise man had entrusted to him Then go back and observe the marvels of my world said the wise man You cannot trust a man if you dont know his house Relieved the boy picked up the spoon and returned to his exploration of the palace this time observing all of the works of art on the ceilings and the walls He saw the gardens the mountains all around him the beauty of the flowers and the taste with which everything had been selected Upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen But where are the drops of oill I entrusted to you asked the wise man Looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oill was gone Well there is only one piece of advice I can give you said the wisest of wise men The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world and never to forget the drops of oill on the spoon The shepherd said nothing He had understood the story the old king had told him A shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep The old man looked at the boy and with his hands held together made several strange gestures over the boys head Then taking his sheep he walked away At the highest point in Tarifa there is an old fort built by the Moors From atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of Africa Melchizedek the king of Salem sat on the wall of the fort that afternoon and felt the levanter blowing in his face The sheep fidgeted nearby uneasy with their new owner and excited by so much change All they wanted was food and water Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port He would never again see the boy just as he had never seen Abraham again after having charged him his onetenth fee That was his work The gods should not have desires because they dont have destinies But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful Its too bad that hes quickly going to forget my name he thought I should have repeated it for him Then when he spoke about me he would say that I am Melchizedek the king of Salem He looked to the skies feeling a bit abashed and said I know its the vanity of vanities as you said my Lord But an old king sometimes has to take some pride in himself How strange Africa is thought the boy He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the narrow streets of Tangier Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other In just a few hours he had seen men walking hand in hand women with their faces covered and priests that climbed to the tops of towers and chantedas everyone about him went to their knees and placed their foreheads on the ground A practice of infidels he said to himself As a child in church he had always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his white horse his sword unsheathed and figures such as these kneeling at his feet The boy felt ill and terribly alone The infidels had an evil look about them Besides this in the rush of his travels he had forgotten a detail just one detail which could keep him from his treasure for a long time only Arabic was spoken in this country The owner of the bar approached him and the boy pointed to a drink that had been served at the next table It turned out to be a bitter tea The boy preferred wine But he didnt need to worry about that right now What he had to be concerned about was his treasure and how he was going to go about getting it The sale of his sheep had left him with enough money in his pouch and the boy knew that in money there was magic whoever has money is never really alone Before long maybe in just a few days he would be at the Pyramids An old man with a breastplate of gold wouldnt have lied just to acquire six sheep The old man had spoken about signs and omens and as the boy was crossing the strait he had thought about omens Yes the old man had known what he was talking about during the time the boy had spent in the fields of Andalusia he had become used to learning which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky He had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a snake was nearby and that a certain shrub was a sign that there was water in the area The sheep had taught him that If God leads the sheep so well he will also lead a man he thought and that made him feel better The tea seemed less bitter Who are you he heard a voice ask him in Spanish The boy was relieved He was thinking about omens and someone had appeared How come you speak Spanish he asked The new arrival was a young man in Western dress but the color of his skin suggested he was from this city He was about the same age and height as the boy Almost everyone here speaks Spanish Were only two hours from Spain Sit down and let me treat you to something said the boy And ask for a glass of wine for me I hate this tea There is no wine in this country the young man said The religion here forbids it The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids He almost began to tell about his treasure but decided not to do so If he did it was possible that the Arab would want a part of it as payment for taking him there He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didnt even have yet Id like you to take me there if you can I can pay you to serve as my guide Do you have any idea how to get there the newcomer asked The boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation He felt uneasy at the mans presence But he had found a guide and didnt want to miss out on an opportunity You have to cross the entire Sahara desert said the young man And to do that you need money I need to know whether you have enough The boy thought it a strange question But he trusted in the old man who had said that when you really want something the universe always conspires in your favor He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young man The owner of the bar came over and looked as well The two men exchanged some words in Arabic and the bar owner seemed irritated Lets get out of here said the new arrival He wants us to leave The boy was relieved He got up to pay the bill but the owner grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of words The boy was strong and wanted to retaliate but he was in a foreign country His new friend pushed the owner aside and pulled the boy outside with him He wanted your money he said Tangier is not like the rest of Africa This is a port and every port has its thieves The boy trusted his new friend He had helped him out in a dangerous situation He took out his money and counted it We could get to the Pyramids by tomorrow said the other taking the money But I have to buy two camels They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held There were thousands of people there arguing selling and buying vegetables for sale amongst daggers and carpets displayed alongside tobacco But the boy never took his eye off his new friend After all he had all his money He thought about asking him to give it back but decided that would be unfriendly He knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in Ill just watch him he said to himself He knew he was stronger than his friend Suddenly there in the midst of all that confusion he saw the most beautiful sword he had ever seen The scabbard was embossed in silver and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones The boy promised himself that when he returned from Egypt he would buy that sword Ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to his friend Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword His heart squeezed as if his chest had suddenly compressed it He was afraid to look around because he knew what he would find He continued to look at the beautiful sword for a bit longer until he summoned the courage to turn around All around him was the market with people coming and going shouting and buying and the aroma of strange foods but nowhere could he find his new companion The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident He decided to stay right there and await his return As he waited a priest climbed to the top of a nearby tower and began his chant everyone in the market fell to their knees touched their foreheads to the ground and took up the chant Then like a colony of worker ants they dismantled their stalls and left The sun began its departure as well The boy watched it through its trajectory for some time until it was hidden behind the white houses surrounding the plaza He recalled that when the sun had risen that morning he was on another continent still a shepherd with sixty sheep and looking forward to meeting with a girl That morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him as he walked through the familiar fields But now as the sun began to set he was in a different country a stranger in a strange land where he couldnt even speak the language He was no longer a shepherd and he had nothing not even the money to return and start everything over All this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought He was feeling sorry for himself and lamenting the fact that his life could have changed so suddenly and so drastically He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry He had never even wept in front of his own sheep But the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept He wept because God was unfair and because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams When I had my sheep I was happy and I made those around me happy People saw me coming and welcomed me he thought But now Im sad and alone Im going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me Im going to hate those who have found their treasure because I never found mine And Im going to hold on to what little I have because Im too insignificant to conquer the world He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship But all he found was the heavy book his jacket and the two stones the old man had given him As he looked at the stones he felt relieved for some reason He had exchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate He could sell the stones and buy a return ticket But this time Ill be smarter the boy thought removing them from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket This was a port town and the only truthful thing his friend had told him was that port towns are full of thieves Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset he was trying to tell him not to trust that man Im like everyone elseI see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen not what actually does He ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces They were his treasure Just handling them made him feel better They reminded him of the old man When you want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it he had said The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said There he was in the empty marketplace without a cent to his name and with not a sheep to guard through the night But the stones were proof that he had met with a kinga king who knew of the boys past Theyre called Urim and Thummim and they can help you to read the omens The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment The old man had said to ask very clear questions and to do that the boy had to know what he wanted So he asked if the old mans blessing was still with him He took out one of the stones It was yes Am I going to find my treasure he asked He stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones As he did so both of them pushed through a hole in the pouch and fell to the ground The boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch But as he saw them lying there on the ground another phrase came to his mind Learn to recognize omens and follow them the old king had said An omen The boy smiled to himself He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch He didnt consider mending the holethe stones could fall through any time they wanted He had learned that there were certain things one shouldnt ask about so as not to flee from ones own destiny I promised that I would make my own decisions he said to himself But the stones had told him that the old man was still with him and that made him feel more confident He looked around at the empty plaza again feeling less desperate than before This wasnt a strange place it was a new one After all what he had always wanted was just that to know new places Even if he never got to the Pyramids he had already traveled farther than any shepherd he knew Oh if they only knew how different things are just two hours by ship from where they are he thought Although his new world at the moment was just an empty marketplace he had already seen it when it was teeming with life and he would never forget it He remembered the sword It hurt him a bit to think about it but he had never seen one like it before As he mused about these things he realized that he had to choose between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure Im an adventurer looking for treasure he said to himself He was shaken into wakefulness by someone He had fallen asleep in the middle of the marketplace and life in the plaza was about to resume Looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world But instead of being saddened he was happy He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep he could go in search of his treasure instead He had not a cent in his pocket but he had faith He had decided the night before that he would be as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books He walked slowly through the market The merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his The candy seller had a smile on his face he was happy aware of what his life was about and ready to begin a days work His smile reminded the boy of the old manthe mysterious old king he had met This candy merchant isnt making candy so that later he can travel or marry a shopkeepers daughter Hes doing it because its what he wants to do thought the boy He realized that he could do the same thing the old man had donesense whether a person was near to or far from his destiny Just by looking at them Its easy and yet Ive never done it before he thought When the stall was assembled the candy seller offered the boy the first sweet he had made for the day The boy thanked him ate it and went on his way When he had gone only a short distance he realized that while they were erecting the stall one of them had spoken Arabic and the other Spanish And they had understood each other perfectly well There must be a language that doesnt depend on words the boy thought Ive already had that experience with my sheep and now its happening with people He was learning a lot of new things Some of them were things that he had already experienced and werent really new but that he had never perceived before And he hadnt perceived them because he had become accustomed to them He realized If I can learn to understand this language without words I can learn to understand the world Relaxed and unhurried he resolved that he would walk through the narrow streets of Tangier Only in that way would he be able to read the omens He knew it would require a lot of patience but shepherds know all about patience Once again he saw that in that strange land he was applying the same lessons he had learned with his sheep All things are one the old man had said The crystal merchant awoke with the day and felt the same anxiety that he felt every morning He had been in the same place for thirty years a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed Now it was too late to change anythingthe only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware There had been a time when many people knew of his shop Arab merchants French and English geologists German soldiers who were always wellheeled In those days it had been wonderful to be selling crystal and he had thought how he would become rich and have beautiful women at his side as he grew older But as time passed Tangier had changed The nearby city of Ceuta had grown faster than Tangier and business had fallen off Neighbors moved away and there remained only a few small shops on the hill And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops But the crystal merchant had no choice He had lived thirty years of his life buying and selling crystal pieces and now it was too late to do anything else He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street He had done this for years and knew the schedule of everyone who passed But just before lunchtime a boy stopped in front of the shop He was dressed normally but the practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no money to spend Nevertheless the merchant decided to delay his lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on A card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop The boy saw a man appear behind the counter I can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy The way they look now nobody is going to want to buy them The man looked at him without responding In exchange you could give me something to eat The man still said nothing and the boy sensed that he was going to have to make a decision In his pouch he had his jackethe certainly wasnt going to need it in the desert Taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses In half an hour he had cleaned all the glasses in the window and as he was doing so two customers had entered the shop and bought some crystal When he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat Lets go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant He put a sign on the door and they went to a small caf nearby As they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed You didnt have to do any cleaning he said The Koran requires me to feed a hungry person Well then why did you let me do it the boy asked Because the crystal was dirty And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts When they had eaten the merchant turned to the boy and said Id like you to work in my shop Two customers came in today while you were working and thats a good omen People talk a lot about omens thought the shepherd But they really dont know what theyre saying Just as I hadnt realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep Do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked I can work for the rest of today the boy answered Ill work all night until dawn and Ill clean every piece of crystal in your shop In return I need money to get to Egypt tomorrow The merchant laughed Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year even if you earned a good commission selling every piece you would still have to borrow money to get to Egypt There are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep No sound from the bazaars no arguments among the merchants no men climbing to the towers to chant No hope no adventure no old kings or destinies no treasure and no Pyramids It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boys soul had He sat there staring blankly through the door of the caf wishing that he had died and that everything would end forever at that moment The merchant looked anxiously at the boy All the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared I can give you the money you need to get back to your country my son said the crystal merchant The boy said nothing He got up adjusted his clothing and picked up his pouch Ill work for you he said And after another long silence he added I need money to buy some sheep PART TWO The boy had been working for the crystal merchant for almost a month and he could see that it wasnt exactly the kind of job that would make him happy The merchant spent the entire day mumbling behind the counter telling the boy to be careful with the pieces and not to break anything But he stayed with the job because the merchant although he was an old grouch treated him fairly the boy received a good commission for each piece he sold and had already been able to put some money aside That morning he had done some calculating if he continued to work every day as he had been he would need a whole year to be able to buy some sheep Id like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant We could place it outside and attract those people who pass at the bottom of the hill Ive never had one before the merchant answered People will pass by and bump into it and pieces will be broken Well when I took my sheep through the fields some of them might have died if we had come upon a snake But thats the way life is with sheep and with shepherds The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses He was selling better than ever as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangiers major attractions Business has really improved he said to the boy after the customer had left Im doing much better and soon youll be able to return to your sheep Why ask more out of life Because we have to respond to omens the boy said almost without meaning to then he regretted what he had said because the merchant had never met the king Its called the principle of favorability beginners luck Because life wants you to achieve your destiny the old king had said But the merchant understood what the boy had said The boys very presence in the shop was an omen and as time passed and money was pouring into the cash drawer he had no regrets about having hired the boy The boy was being paid more money than he deserved because the merchant thinking that sales wouldnt amount to much had offered the boy a high commission rate He had assumed he would soon return to his sheep Why did you want to get to the Pyramids he asked to get away from the business of the display Because Ive always heard about them the boy answered saying nothing about his dream The treasure was now nothing but a painful memory and he tried to avoid thinking about it I dont know anyone around here who would want to cross the desert just to see the Pyramids said the merchant Theyre just a pile of stones You could build one in your backyard Youve never had dreams of travel said the boy turning to wait on a customer who had entered the shop Two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display I dont much like change he said You and I arent like Hassan that rich merchant If he makes a buying mistake it doesnt affect him much But we two have to live with our mistakes Thats true enough the boy thought ruefully Why did you think we should have the display I want to get back to my sheep faster We have to take advantage when luck is on our side and do as much to help it as its doing to help us Its called the principle of favorability Or beginners luck The merchant was silent for a few moments Then he said The Prophet gave us the Koran and left us just five obligations to satisfy during our lives The most important is to believe only in the one true God The others are to pray five times a day fast during Ramadan and be charitable to the poor He stopped there His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the Prophet He was a devout man and even with all his impatience he wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law Whats the fifth obligation the boy asked Two days ago you said that I had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a pilgrimage We are obliged at least once in our lives to visit the holy city of Mecca Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids When I was young all I wanted to do was put together enough money to start this shop I thought that someday Id be rich and could go to Mecca I began to make some money but I could never bring myself to leave someone in charge of the shop the crystals are delicate things At the same time people were passing my shop all the time heading for Mecca Some of them were rich pilgrims traveling in caravans with servants and camels but most of the people making the pilgrimage were poorer than I All who went there were happy at having done so They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses One of them a cobbler who made his living mending boots said that he had traveled for almost a year through the desert but that he got more tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather Well why dont you go to Mecca now asked the boy Because its the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive Thats what helps me face these days that are all the same these mute crystals on the shelves and lunch and dinner at that same horrible caf Im afraid that if my dream is realized Ill have no reason to go on living You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids but youre different from me because you want to realize your dreams I just want to dream about Mecca Ive already imagined a thousand times crossing the desert arriving at the Plaza of the Sacred Stone the seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it Ive already imagined the people who would be at my side and those in front of me and the conversations and prayers we would share But Im afraid that it would all be a disappointment so I prefer just to dream about it That day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way Two more months passed and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop The boy estimated that if he worked for six more months he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep and yet another sixty In less than a year he would have doubled his flock and he would be able to do business with the Arabs because he was now able to speak their strange language Since that morning in the marketplace he had never again made use of Urim and Thummim because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was Mecca for the merchant Anyway the boy had become happy in his work and thought all the time about the day when he would disembark at Tarifa as a winner You must always know what it is that you want the old king had said The boy knew and was now working toward it Maybe it was his treasure to have wound up in that strange land met up with a thief and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent He was proud of himself He had learned some important things like how to deal in crystal and about the language without words and about omens One afternoon he had seen a man at the top of the hill complaining that it was impossible to find a decent place to get something to drink after such a climb The boy accustomed to recognizing omens spoke to the merchant Lets sell tea to the people who climb the hill Lots of places sell tea around here the merchant said But we could sell tea in crystal glasses The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men The merchant didnt respond but that afternoon after saying his prayers and closing the shop he invited the boy to sit with him and share his hookah that strange pipe used by the Arabs What is it youre looking for asked the old merchant Ive already told you I need to buy my sheep back so I have to earn the money to do so The merchant put some new coals in the hookah and inhaled deeply Ive had this shop for thirty years I know good crystal from bad and everything else there is to know about crystal I know its dimensions and how it behaves If we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand And then Ill have to change my way of life Well isnt that good Im already used to the way things are Before you came I was thinking about how much time I had wasted in the same place while my friends had moved on and either went bankrupt or did better than they had before It made me very depressed Now I can see that it hasnt been too bad The shop is exactly the size I always wanted it to be I dont want to change anything because I dont know how to deal with change Im used to the way I am The boy didnt know what to say The old man continued You have been a real blessing to me Today I understand something I didnt see before every blessing ignored becomes a curse I dont want anything else in life But you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons I have never known Now that I have seen them and now that I see how immense my possibilities are Im going to feel worse than I did before you arrived Because I know the things I should be able to accomplish and I dont want to do so Its good I refrained from saying anything to the baker in Tarifa thought the boy to himself They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set They were conversing in Arabic and the boy was proud of himself for being able to do so There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world But they could never have taught him Arabic There are probably other things in the world that the sheep cant teach me thought the boy as he regarded the old merchant All they ever do really is look for food and water And maybe it wasnt that they were teaching me but that I was learning from them Maktub the merchant said finally What does that mean You would have to have been born an Arab to understand he answered But in your language it would be something like It is written And as he smothered the coals in the hookah he told the boy that he could begin to sell tea in the crystal glasses Sometimes theres just no way to hold back the river The men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea They went in to drink the tea which was served in beautiful crystal glasses My wife never thought of this said one and he bought some crystalhe was entertaining guests that night and the guests would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware The other man remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in crystal because the aroma was retained The third said that it was a tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical powers Before long the news spread and a great many people began to climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a trade that was so old Other shops were opened that served tea in crystal but they werent at the top of a hill and they had little business Eventually the merchant had to hire two more employees He began to import enormous quantities of tea along with his crystal and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for things new And in that way the months passed The boy awoke before dawn It had been eleven months and nine days since he had first set foot on the African continent He dressed in his Arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day He put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin Wearing his new sandals he descended the stairs silently The city was still sleeping He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass Then he sat in the sunfilled doorway smoking the hookah He smoked in silence thinking of nothing and listening to the sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert When he had finished his smoke he reached into one of his pockets and sat there for a few moments regarding what he had withdrawn It was a bundle of money Enough to buy himself a hundred and twenty sheep a return ticket and a license to import products from Africa into his own country He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop Then the two went off to have some more tea Im leaving today said the boy I have the money I need to buy my sheep And you have the money you need to go to Mecca The old man said nothing Will you give me your blessing asked the boy You have helped me The man continued to prepare his tea saying nothing Then he turned to the boy I am proud of you he said You brought a new feeling into my crystal shop But you know that Im not going to go to Mecca Just as you know that youre not going to buy your sheep Who told you that asked the boy startled Maktub said the old crystal merchant And he gave the boy his blessing The boy went to his room and packed his belongings They filled three sacks As he was leaving he saw in the corner of the room his old shepherds pouch It was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time As he took his jacket out of the pouch thinking to give it to someone in the street the two stones fell to the floor Urim and Thummim It made the boy think of the old king and it startled him to realize how long it had been since he had thought of him For nearly a year he had been working incessantly thinking only of putting aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride Never stop dreaming the old king had said Follow the omens The boy picked up Urim and Thummim and once again had the strange sensation that the old king was nearby He had worked hard for a year and the omens were that it was time to go Im going to go back to doing just what I did before the boy thought Even though the sheep didnt teach me to speak Arabic But the sheep had taught him something even more important that there was a language in the world that everyone understood a language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to improve things at the shop It was the language of enthusiasm of things accomplished with love and purpose and as part of a search for something believed in and desired Tangier was no longer a strange city and he felt that just as he had conquered this place he could conquer the world When you want something all the universe conspires to help you achieve it the old king had said But the old king hadnt said anything about being robbed or about endless deserts or about people who know what their dreams are but dont want to realize them The old king hadnt told him that the Pyramids were just a pile of stones or that anyone could build one in his backyard And he had forgotten to mention that when you have enough money to buy a flock larger than the one you had before you should buy it The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things He went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign couple while two other customers walked about the shop drinking tea from crystal glasses It was more activity than usual for this time of the morning From where he stood he saw for the first time that the old merchants hair was very much like the hair of the old king He remembered the smile of the candy seller on his first day in Tangier when he had nothing to eat and nowhere to gothat smile had also been like the old kings smile Its almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought And yet none of these people has ever met the old king On the other hand he said that he always appeared to help those who are trying to realize their destiny He left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant He didnt want to cry with the other people there He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned He was more confident in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world But Im going back to the fields that I know to take care of my flock again He said that to himself with certainty but he was no longer happy with his decision He had worked for an entire year to make a dream come true and that dream minute by minute was becoming less important Maybe because that wasnt really his dream Who knows maybe its better to be like the crystal merchant never go to Mecca and just go through life wanting to do so he thought again trying to convince himself But as he held Urim and Thummim in his hand they had transmitted to him the strength and will of the old king By coincidenceor maybe it was an omen the boy thoughthe came to the bar he had entered on his first day there The thief wasnt there and the owner brought him a cup of tea I can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought I learned how to care for sheep and I havent forgotten how thats done But maybe Ill never have another chance to get to the Pyramids in Egypt The old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past He really was a king a wise king The hills of Andalusia were only two hours away but there was an entire desert between him and the Pyramids Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation he was actually two hours closer to his treasure the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didnt matter I know why I want to get back to my flock he thought I understand sheep theyre no longer a problem and they can be good friends On the other hand I dont know if the desert can be a friend and its in the desert that I have to search for my treasure If I dont find it I can always go home I finally have enough money and all the time I need Why not He suddenly felt tremendously happy He could always go back to being a shepherd He could always become a crystal salesman again Maybe the world had other hidden treasures but he had a dream and he had met with a king That doesnt happen to just anyone He was planning as he left the bar He had remembered that one of the crystal merchants suppliers transported his crystal by means of caravans that crossed the desert He held Urim and Thummim in his hand because of those two stones he was once again on the way to his treasure I am always nearby when someone wants to realize their destiny the old king had told him What could it cost to go over to the suppliers warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far away The Englishman was sitting on a bench in a structure that smelled of animals sweat and dust it was part warehouse part corral I never thought Id end up in a place like this he thought as he leafed through the pages of a chemical journal Ten years at the university and here I am in a corral But he had to move on He believed in omens All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the universe First he had studied Esperanto then the worlds religions and now it was alchemy He knew how to speak Esperanto he understood all the major religions well but he wasnt yet an alchemist He had unraveled the truths behind important questions but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not seem to go He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist But the alchemists were strange people who thought only about themselves and almost always refused to help him Who knows maybe they had failed to discover the secret of the Master Workthe Philosophers Stone and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his father fruitlessly seeking the Philosophers Stone He had spent enormous amounts of time at the great libraries of the world and had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemy In one he had read that many years ago a famous Arabian alchemist had visited Europe It was said that he was more than two hundred years old and that he had discovered the Philosophers Stone and the Elixir of Life The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story But he would never have thought it more than just a myth had not a friend of his returning from an archaeological expedition in the deserttold him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers He lives at the AlFayoum oasis his friend had said And people say that he is two hundred years old and is able to transform any metal into gold The Englishman could not contain his excitement He canceled all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his books and now here he was sitting inside a dusty smelly warehouse Outside a huge caravan was being prepared for a crossing of the Sahara and was scheduled to pass through AlFayoum Im going to find that damned alchemist the Englishman thought And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable A young Arab also loaded down with baggage entered and greeted the Englishman Where are you bound asked the young Arab Im going into the desert the man answered turning back to his reading He didnt want any conversation at this point What he needed to do was review all he had learned over the years because the alchemist would certainly put him to the test The young Arab took out a book and began to read The book was written in Spanish Thats good thought the Englishman He spoke Spanish better than Arabic and if this boy was going to Al Fayoum there would be someone to talk to when there were no other important things to do Thats strange said the boy as he tried once again to read the burial scene that began the book Ive been trying for two years to read this book and I never get past these first few pages Even without a king to provide an interruption he was unable to concentrate He still had some doubts about the decision he had made But he was able to understand one thing making a decision was only the beginning of things When someone makes a decision he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision When I decided to seek out my treasure I never imagined that Id wind up working in a crystal shop he thought And joining this caravan may have been my decision but where it goes is going to be a mystery to me Nearby was the Englishman reading a book He seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered They might even have become friends but the Englishman closed off the conversation The boy closed his book He felt that he didnt want to do anything that might make him look like the Englishman He took Urim and Thummim from his pocket and began playing with them The stranger shouted Urim and Thummim In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket Theyre not for sale he said Theyre not worth much the Englishman answered Theyre only made of rock crystal and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth But those who know about such things would know that those are Urim and Thummim I didnt know that they had them in this part of the world They were given to me as a present by a king the boy said The stranger didnt answer instead he put his hand in his pocket and took out two stones that were the same as the boys Did you say a king he asked I guess you dont believe that a king would talk to someone like me a shepherd he said wanting to end the conversation Not at all It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a king that the rest of the world refused to acknowledge So its not surprising that kings would talk to shepherds And he went on fearing that the boy wouldnt understand what he was talking about Its in the Bible The same book that taught me about Urim and Thummim These stones were the only form of divination permitted by God The priests carried them in a golden breastplate The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse Maybe this is an omen said the Englishman half aloud Who told you about omens The boys interest was increasing by the moment Everything in life is an omen said the Englishman now closing the journal he was reading There is a universal language understood by everybody but already forgotten I am in search of that universal language among other things Thats why Im here I have to find a man who knows that universal language An alchemist The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss Youre in luck you two the fat Arab said Theres a caravan leaving today for AlFayoum But Im going to Egypt the boy said AlFayoum is in Egypt said the Arab What kind of Arab are you Thats a good luck omen the Englishman said after the fat Arab had gone out If I could Id write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence Its with those words that the universal language is written He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with Urim and Thummim in his hand And he asked the boy if he too were in search of the alchemist Im looking for a treasure said the boy and he immediately regretted having said it But the Englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it In a way so am I he said I dont even know what alchemy is the boy was saying when the warehouse boss called to them to come outside Im the leader of the caravan said a darkeyed bearded man I hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me The desert is a capricious lady and sometimes she drives men crazy There were almost two hundred people gathered there and four hundred animals camels horses mules and fowl In the crowd were women children and a number of men with swords at their belts and rifles slung on their shoulders The Englishman had several suitcases filled with books There was a babble of noise and the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to understand what he was saying There are a lot of different people here and each has his own God But the only God I serve is Allah and in his name I swear that I will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert But I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders no matter what In the desert disobedience means death There was a murmur from the crowd Each was swearing quietly to his or her own God The boy swore to Jesus Christ The Englishman said nothing And the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have The people were also praying to heaven for protection A long note was sounded on a bugle and everyone mounted up The boy and the Englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs The boy felt sorry for the Englishmans camel loaded down as he was with the cases of books Theres no such thing as coincidence said the Englishman picking up the conversation where it had been interrupted in the warehouse Im here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who But the caravan began to move and it was impossible to hear what the Englishman was saying The boy knew what he was about to describe though the mysterious chain that links one thing to another the same chain that had caused him to become a shepherd that had caused his recurring dream that had brought him to a city near Africa to find a king and to be robbed in order to meet a crystal merchant and The closer one gets to realizing his destiny the more that destiny becomes his true reason for being thought the boy The caravan moved toward the east It traveled during the morning halted when the sun was at its strongest and resumed late in the afternoon The boy spoke very little with the Englishman who spent most of his time with his books The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert Now everything was quite different from how it was that day they had set out then there had been confusion and shouting the cries of children and the whinnying of animals all mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants But in the desert there was only the sound of the eternal wind and of the hoofbeats of the animals Even the guides spoke very little to one another Ive crossed these sands many times said one of the camel drivers one night But the desert is so huge and the horizons so distant that they make a person feel small and as if he should remain silent The boy understood intuitively what he meant even without ever having set foot in the desert before Whenever he saw the sea or a fire he fell silent impressed by their elemental force Ive learned things from the sheep and Ive learned things from crystal he thought I can learn something from the desert too It seems old and wise The wind never stopped and the boy remembered the day he had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face It reminded him of the wool from his sheep his sheep who were now seeking food and water in the fields of Andalusia as they always had Theyre not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia They must be used to their new shepherd and have probably already forgotten me Thats good Creatures like the sheep that are used to traveling know about moving on He thought of the merchants daughter and was sure that she had probably married Perhaps to a baker or to another shepherd who could read and could tell her exciting storiesafter all he probably wasnt the only one But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel drivers comment maybe he was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the present of all people Hunches his mother used to call them The boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life where the histories of all people are connected and we are able to know everything because its all written there Maktub the boy said remembering the crystal merchant The desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others When the caravan was blocked by a boulder it had to go around it if there was a large rocky area they had to make a major detour If the sand was too fine for the animals hooves they sought a way where the sand was more substantial In some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes The animals balked at such places and the camel drivers were forced to dismount and unburden their charges The drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels If a guide were to fall ill or die the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new one But all this happened for one basic reason no matter how many detours and adjustments it made the caravan moved toward the same compass point Once obstacles were overcome it returned to its course sighting on a star that indicated the location of the oasis When the people saw that star shining in the morning sky they knew they were on the right course toward water palm trees shelter and other people It was only the Englishman who was unaware of all this he was for the most part immersed in reading his books The boy too had his book and he had tried to read it during the first few days of the journey But he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind As soon as he had learned to know his camel better and to establish a relationship with him he threw the book away Although the boy had developed a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn something important he decided it was an unnecessary burden He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him At night as they sat around the fire the boy related to the driver his adventures as a shepherd During one of these conversations the driver told of his own life I used to live near Ell Cairum he said I had my orchard my children and a life that would change not at all until I died One year when the crop was the best ever we all went to Mecca and I satisfied the only unmet obligation in my life I could die happily and that made me feel good One day the earth began to tremble and the Nile overflowed its banks It was something that I thought could happen only to others never to me My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive trees in the flood and my wife was afraid that we would lose our children I thought that everything I owned would be destroyed The land was ruined and I had to find some other way to earn a living So now Im a camel driver But that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want We are afraid of losing what we have whether its our life or our possessions and property But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand Sometimes their caravan met with another One always had something that the other neededas if everything were indeed written by one hand As they sat around the fire the camel drivers exchanged information about windstorms and told stories about the desert At other times mysterious hooded men would appear they were Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route They provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes They came in silence and departed the same way dressed in black garments that showed only their eyes One night a camel driver came to the fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting There are rumors of tribal wars he told them The three fell silent The boy noted that there was a sense of fear in the air even though no one said anything Once again he was experiencing the language without words the universal language The Englishman asked if they were in danger Once you get into the desert theres no going back said the camel driver And when you cant go back you have to worry only about the best way of moving forward The rest is up to Allah including the danger And he concluded by saying the mysterious word Maktub You should pay more attention to the caravan the boy said to the Englishman after the camel driver had left We make a lot of detours but were always heading for the same destination And you ought to read more about the world answered the Englishman Books are like caravans in that respect The immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster The days had always been silent but now even the nightswhen the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fireshad also become quiet And one day the leader of the caravan made the decision that the fires should no longer be lighted so as not to attract attention to the caravan The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a circle at night sleeping together in the center as protection against the nocturnal cold And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group The Englishman was unable to sleep one night He called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment There was a full moon and the boy told the Englishman the story of his life The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there Thats the principle that governs all things he said In alchemy its called the Soul of the World When you want something with all your heart thats when you are closest to the Soul of the World Its always a positive force He also said that this was not just a human gift that everything on the face of the earth had a soul whether mineral vegetable or animalor even just a simple thought Everything on earth is being continuously transformed because the earth is alive and it has a soul We are part of that soul so we rarely recognize that it is working for us But in the crystal shop you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your success The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon and the bleached sands I have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said The caravan and the desert speak the same language and its for that reason that the desert allows the crossing Its going to test the caravans every step to see if its in time and if it is we will make it to the oasis If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal courage but without understanding that language this journey would have been much more difficult They stood there looking at the moon Thats the magic of omens said the boy Ive seen how the guides read the signs of the desert and how the soul of the caravan speaks to the soul of the desert The Englishman said Id better pay more attention to the caravan And Id better read your books said the boy They were strange books They spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didnt understand any of it But there was one idea that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books all things are the manifestation of one thing only In one of the books he learned that the most important text in the literature of alchemy contained only a few lines and had been inscribed on the surface of an emerald Its the Emerald Tablet said the Englishman proud that he might teach something to the boy Well then why do we need all these books the boy asked So that we can understand those few lines the Englishman answered without appearing really to believe what he had said The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists They were men who had dedicated their entire lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories they believed that if a metal were heated for many years it would free itself of all its individual properties and what was left would be the Soul of the World This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything on the face of the earth because it was the language with which all things communicated They called that discovery the Master Workit was part liquid and part solid Cant you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language the boy asked You have a mania for simplifying everything answered the Englishman irritated Alchemy is a serious discipline Every step has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was called the Elixir of Life and that it cured all illnesses it also kept the alchemist from growing old And the solid part was called the Philosophers Stone Its not easy to find the Philosophers Stone said the Englishman The alchemists spent years in their laboratories observing the fire that purified the metals They spent so much time close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a purification of themselves The boy thought about the crystal merchant He had said that it was a good thing for the boy to clean the crystal pieces so that he could free himself from negative thoughts The boy was becoming more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in ones daily life Also said the Englishman the Philosophers Stone has a fascinating property A small sliver of the stone can transform large quantities of metal into gold Having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy He thought that with some patience hed be able to transform everything into gold He read the lives of the various people who had succeeded in doing so Helvtius Elias Fulcanelli and Geber They were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end They traveled spoke with wise men performed miracles for the incredulous and owned the Philosophers Stone and the Elixir of Life But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master Work he became completely lost There were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts Why do they make things so complicated he asked the Englishman one night The boy had noticed that the Englishman was irritable and missed his books So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand he said Imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold Gold would lose its value Its only those who are persistent and willing to study things deeply who achieve the Master Work Thats why Im here in the middle of the desert Im seeking a true alchemist who will help me to decipher the codes When were these books written the boy asked Many centuries ago They didnt have the printing press in those days the boy argued There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy Why did they use such strange language with so many drawings The Englishman didnt answer him directly He said that for the past few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan operated but that he hadnt learned anything new The only thing he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more frequent Then one day the boy returned the books to the Englishman Did you learn anything the Englishman asked eager to hear what it might be He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war I learned that the world has a soul and that whoever understands that soul can also understand the language of things I learned that many alchemists realized their destinies and wound up discovering the Soul of the World the Philosophers Stone and the Elixir of Life But above all I learned that these things are all so simple that they could be written on the surface of an emerald The Englishman was disappointed The years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment none of this had made an impression on the boy His soul must be too primitive to understand those things he thought He took back his books and packed them away again in their bags Go back to watching the caravan he said That didnt teach me anything either The boy went back to contemplating the silence of the desert and the sand raised by the animals Everyone has his or her own way of learning things he said to himself His way isnt the same as mine nor mine as his But were both in search of our destinies and I respect him for that The caravan began to travel day and night The hooded Bedouins reappeared more and more frequently and the camel driverwho had become a good friend of the boys explained that the war between the tribes had already begun The caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis The animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less The silence was the worst aspect of the night when the mere groan of a camelwhich before had been nothing but the groan of a camelnow frightened everyone because it might signal a raid The camel driver though seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war Im alive he said to the boy as they ate a bunch of dates one night with no fires and no moon When Im eating thats all I think about If Im on the march I just concentrate on marching If I have to fight it will be just as good a day to die as any other Because I dont live in either my past or my future Im interested only in the present If you can concentrate always on the present youll be a happy man Youll see that there is life in the desert that there are stars in the heavens and that tribesmen fight because they are part of the human race Life will be a party for you a grand festival because life is the moment were living right now Two nights later as he was getting ready to bed down the boy looked for the star they followed every night He thought that the horizon was a bit lower than it had been because he seemed to see stars on the desert itself Its the oasis said the camel driver Well why dont we go there right now the boy asked Because we have to sleep The boy awoke as the sun rose There in front of him where the small stars had been the night before was an endless row of date palms stretching across the entire desert Weve done it said the Englishman who had also awakened early But the boy was quiet He was at home with the silence of the desert and he was content just to look at the trees He still had a long way to go to reach the pyramids and someday this morning would just be a memory But this was the present momentthe party the camel driver had mentionedand he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future Although the vision of the date palms would someday be just a memory right now it signified shade water and a refuge from the war Yesterday the camels groan signaled danger and now a row of date palms could herald a miracle The world speaks many languages the boy thought The times rush past and so do the caravans thought the alchemist as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the oasis People were shouting at the new arrivals dust obscured the desert sun and the children of the oasis were bursting with excitement at the arrival of the strangers The alchemist saw the tribal chiefs greet the leader of the caravan and converse with him at length But none of that mattered to the alchemist He had already seen many people come and go and the desert remained as it was He had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands The dunes were changed constantly by the wind yet these were the same sands he had known since he was a child He always enjoyed seeing the happiness that the travelers experienced when after weeks of yellow sand and blue sky they first saw the green of the date palms Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date trees he thought He decided to concentrate on more practical matters He knew that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets The omens had told him so He didnt know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice I dont know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth he thought It wasnt exactly that they were secrets God revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures He had only one explanation for this fact things have to be transmitted this way because they were made up from the pure life and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words Because people become fascinated with pictures and words and wind up forgetting the Language of the World The boy couldnt believe what he was seeing the oasis rather than being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees as he had seen once in a geography bookwas much larger than many towns back in Spain There were three hundred wells fifty thousand date trees and innumerable colored tents spread among them It looks like The Thousand and One Nights said the Englishman impatient to meet with the alchemist They were surrounded by children curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving The men of the oasis wanted to know if they had seen any fighting and the women competed with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants The silence of the desert was a distant dream the travelers in the caravan were talking incessantly laughing and shouting as if they had emerged from the spiritual world and found themselves once again in the world of people They were relieved and happy They had been taking careful precautions in the desert but the camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always considered to be neutral territories because the majority of the inhabitants were women and children There were oases throughout the desert but the tribesmen fought in the desert leaving the oases as places of refuge With some difficulty the leader of the caravan brought all his people together and gave them his instructions The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was over Since they were visitors they would have to share living space with those who lived there and would be given the best accommodations That was the law of hospitality Then he asked that everyone including his own sentinels hand over their arms to the men appointed by the tribal chieftains Those are the rules of war the leader explained The oases may not shelter armies or troops To the boys surprise the Englishman took a chromeplated revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms Why a revolver he asked It helped me to trust in people the Englishman answered Meanwhile the boy thought about his treasure The closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became It seemed as if what the old king had called beginners luck were no longer functioning In his pursuit of the dream he was being constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage So he could not be hasty nor impatient If he pushed forward impulsively he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path God placed them along my path He had surprised himself with the thought Until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world Like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do Dont be impatient he repeated to himself Its like the camel driver said Eat when its time to eat And move along when its time to move along That first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the Englishman The boy was assigned a place far from his friend in a tent with five other young men of about his age They were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities The boy told them about his life as a shepherd and was about to tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent Ive been looking for you all morning he said as he led the boy outside I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives First they tried to find him on their own An alchemist would probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of the people at the oasis and it was likely that in his tent an oven was continuously burning They searched everywhere and found that the oasis was much larger than they could have imagined there were hundreds of tents Weve wasted almost the entire day said the Englishman sitting down with the boy near one of the wells Maybe wed better ask someone the boy suggested The Englishman didnt want to tell others about his reasons for being at the oasis and couldnt make up his mind But finally he agreed that the boy who spoke better Arabic than he should do so The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water Good afternoon maam Im trying to find out where the alchemist lives here at the oasis The woman said she had never heard of such a person and hurried away But before she fled she advised the boy that he had better not try to converse with women who were dressed in black because they were married women He should respect tradition The Englishman was disappointed It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing The boy was also saddened his friend was in pursuit of his destiny And when someone was in such pursuit the entire universe made an effort to help him succeedthats what the old king had said He couldnt have been wrong I had never heard of alchemists before the boy said Maybe no one here has either The Englishmans eyes lit up Thats it Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is Find out who it is who cures the peoples illnesses Several women dressed in black came to the well for water but the boy would speak to none of them despite the Englishmans insistence Then a man approached Do you know someone here who cures peoples illnesses the boy asked Allah cures our illnesses said the man clearly frightened of the strangers Youre looking for witch doctors He spoke some verses from the Koran and moved on Another man appeared He was older and was carrying a small bucket The boy repeated his question Why do you want to find that sort of person the Arab asked Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order to meet with him the boy said If such a man is here at the oasis he must be the very powerful one said the old man after thinking for a few moments Not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to Only when he consents Wait for the end of the war Then leave with the caravan Dont try to enter into the life of the oasis he said and walked away But the Englishman was exultant They were on the right track Finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black She had a vessel on her shoulder and her head was covered by a veil but her face was uncovered The boy approached her to ask about the alchemist At that moment it seemed to him that time stood still and the Soul of the World surged within him When he looked into her dark eyes and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spokethe language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart It was love Something older than humanity more ancient than the desert Something that exerted the same force whenever two pairs of eyes met as had theirs here at the well She smiled and that was certainly an omenthe omen he had been awaiting without even knowing he was for all his life The omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his books in the crystals and in the silence of the desert It was the pure Language of the World It required no explanation just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life and that with no need for words she recognized the same thing He was more certain of it than of anything in the world He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed But maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language Because when you know that language its easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you whether its in the middle of the desert or in some great city And when two such people encounter each other and their eyes meet the past and the future become unimportant There is only that moment and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only It is the hand that evokes love and creates a twin soul for every person in the world Without such love ones dreams would have no meaning Maktub thought the boy The Englishman shook the boy Come on ask her The boy stepped closer to the girl and when she smiled he did the same Whats your name he asked Fatima the girl said averting her eyes Thats what some women in my country are called Its the name of the Prophets daughter Fatima said The invaders carried the name everywhere The beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride The Englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured peoples illnesses Thats the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said He communicates with the genies of the desert The genies were the spirits of good and evil And the girl pointed to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived Then she filled her vessel with water and left The Englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist And the boy sat there by the well for a long time remembering that one day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that woman and realizing that he had loved her before he even knew she existed He knew that his love for her would enable him to discover every treasure in the world The next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl To his surprise the Englishman was there looking out at the desert I waited all afternoon and evening he said He appeared with the first stars of evening I told him what I was seeking and he asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold I told him that was what I had come here to learn He told me I should try to do so Thats all he said Go and try The boy didnt say anything The poor Englishman had traveled all this way only to be told that he should repeat what he had already done so many times So then try he said to the Englishman Thats what Im going to do Im going to start now As the Englishman left Fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water I came to tell you just one thing the boy said I want you to be my wife I love you The girl dropped the container and the water spilled Im going to wait here for you every day I have crossed the desert in search of a treasure that is somewhere near the Pyramids and for me the war seemed a curse But now its a blessing because it brought me to you The war is going to end someday the girl said The boy looked around him at the date palms He reminded himself that he had been a shepherd and that he could be a shepherd again Fatima was more important than his treasure The tribesmen are always in search of treasure the girl said as if she had guessed what he was thinking And the women of the desert are proud of their tribesmen She refilled her vessel and left The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima He told her about his life as a shepherd about the king and about the crystal shop They became friends and except for the fifteen minutes he spent with her each day seemed that it would never pass When he had been at the oasis for almost a month the leader of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with him We dont know when the war will end so we cant continue our journey he said The battles may last for a long time perhaps even years There are powerful forces on both sides and the war is important to both armies Its not a battle of good against evil Its a war between forces that are fighting for the balance of power and when that type of battle begins it lasts longer than othersbecause Allah is on both sides The people went back to where they were living and the boy went to meet with Fatima that afternoon He told her about the mornings meeting The day after we met Fatima said you told me that you loved me Then you taught me something of the universal language and the Soul of the World Because of that I have become a part of you The boy listened to the sound of her voice and thought it to be more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time I have forgotten about my past about my traditions and the way in which men of the desert expect women to behave Ever since I was a child I have dreamed that the desert would bring me a wonderful present Now my present has arrived and its you The boy wanted to take her hand But Fatimas hands held to the handles of her jug You have told me about your dreams about the old king and your treasure And youve told me about omens So now I fear nothing because it was those omens that brought you to me And I am a part of your dream a part of your destiny as you call it Thats why I want you to continue toward your goal If you have to wait until the war is over then wait But if you have to go before then go on in pursuit of your dream The dunes are changed by the wind but the desert never changes Thats the way it will be with our love for each other Maktub she said If I am really a part of your dream youll come back one day The boy was sad as he left her that day He thought of all the married shepherds he had known They had a difficult time convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields Love required them to stay with the people they loved He told Fatima that at their next meeting The desert takes our men from us and they dont always return she said We know that and we are used to it Those who dont return become a part of the clouds a part of the animals that hide in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth They become a part of everything they become the Soul of the World Some do come back And then the other women are happy because they believe that their men may one day return as well I used to look at those women and envy them their happiness Now I too will be one of the women who wait Im a desert woman and Im proud of that I want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes And if I have to I will accept the fact that he has become a part of the clouds and the animals and the water of the desert The boy went to look for the Englishman He wanted to tell him about Fatima He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman had built himself a furnace outside his tent It was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top As the Englishman stared out at the desert his eyes seemed brighter than they had when he was reading his books This is the first phase of the job he said I have to separate out the sulfur To do that successfully I must have no fear of failure It was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master Work Now Im beginning what I could have started ten years ago But Im happy at least that I didnt wait twenty years He continued to feed the fire and the boy stayed on until the desert turned pink in the setting sun He felt the urge to go out into the desert to see if its silence held the answers to his questions He wandered for a while keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight He listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet Here and there he found a shell and realized that the desert in remote times had been a sea He sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon He tried to deal with the concept of love as distinct from possession and couldnt separate them But Fatima was a woman of the desert and if anything could help him to understand it was the desert As he sat there thinking he sensed movement above him Looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind Although their flight appeared to have no pattern it made a certain kind of sense to the boy It was just that he couldnt grasp what it meant He followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership He felt sleepy In his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep I am learning the Language of the World and everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me even the flight of the hawks he said to himself And in that mood he was grateful to be in love When you are in love things make even more sense he thought Suddenly one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky attacking the other As it did so a sudden fleeting image came to the boy an army with its swords at the ready riding into the oasis The vision vanished immediately but it had shaken him He had heard people speak of mirages and had already seen some himself they were desires that because of their intensity materialized over the sands of the desert But he certainly didnt desire that an army invade the oasis He wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation He tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert and its stones But there was something there in his heart that wouldnt allow him to do so Always heed the omens the old king had said The boy recalled what he had seen in the vision and sensed that it was actually going to occur He rose and made his way back toward the palm trees Once again he perceived the many languages in the things about him this time the desert was safe and it was the oasis that had become dangerous The camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree observing the sunset He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes An army is coming the boy said I had a vision The desert fills mens hearts with visions the camel driver answered But the boy told him about the hawks that he had been watching their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul of the World The camel driver understood what the boy was saying He knew that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history of all things One could open a book to any page or look at a persons hand one could turn a card or watch the flight of the birds whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment Actually it wasnt that those things in themselves revealed anything at all it was just that people looking at what was occurring around them could find a means of penetration to the Soul of the World The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World They were known as seers and they were held in fear by women and the elderly Tribesmen were also wary of consulting them because it would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was fated to die The tribesmen preferred the taste of battle and the thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be the future was already written by Allah and what he had written was always for the good of man So the tribesmen lived only for the present because the present was full of surprises and they had to be aware of many things Where was the enemys sword Where was his horse What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive The camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers Many of them had been right about what they said while some had been wrong Then one day the oldest seer he had ever sought out and the one most to be feared had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future Well so I can do things he had responded And so I can change those things that I dont want to happen But then they wouldnt be a part of your future the seer had said Well maybe I just want to know the future so I can prepare myself for whats coming If good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer If bad things are and you know in advance you will suffer greatly before they even occur I want to know about the future because Im a man the camel driver had said to the seer And men always live their lives based on the future The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs he threw them on the ground and made interpretations based on how they fell That day he didnt make a cast He wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth and put them back in his bag I make my living forecasting the future for people he said I know the science of the twigs and I know how to use them to penetrate to the place where all is written There I can read the past discover what has already been forgotten and understand the omens that are here in the present When people consult me its not that Im reading the future I am guessing at the future The future belongs to God and it is only he who reveals it under extraordinary circumstances How do I guess at the future Based on the omens of the present The secret is here in the present If you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it And if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better Forget about the future and live each day according to the teachings confident that God loves his children Each day in itself brings with it an eternity The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under which God would allow him to see the future Only when he himself reveals it And God only rarely reveals the future When he does so it is for only one reason its a future that was written so as to be altered God had shown the boy a part of the future the camel driver thought Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument Go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver Tell them about the armies that are approaching Theyll laugh at me They are men of the desert and the men of the desert are used to dealing with omens Well then they probably already know Theyre not concerned with that right now They believe that if they have to know about something Allah wants them to know someone will tell them about it It has happened many times before But this time the person is you The boy thought of Fatima And he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes The boy approached the guard at the front of the huge white tent at the center of the oasis I want to see the chieftains Ive brought omens from the desert Without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time When he emerged it was with a young Arab dressed in white and gold The boy told the younger man what he had seen and the man asked him to wait there He disappeared into the tent Night fell and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and exited the tent One by one the campfires were extinguished and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert Only the lights in the great tent remained During all this time the boy thought about Fatima and he was still unable to understand his last conversation with her Finally after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter The boy was astonished by what he saw inside Never could he have imagined that there in the middle of the desert there existed a tent like this one The ground was covered with the most beautiful carpets he had ever walked upon and from the top of the structure hung lamps of handwrought gold each with a lighted candle The tribal chieftains were seated at the back of the tent in a semicircle resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions Servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea Other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs The atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke There were eight chieftains but the boy could see immediately which of them was the most important an Arab dressed in white and gold seated at the center of the semicircle At his side was the young Arab the boy had spoken with earlier Who is this stranger who speaks of omens asked one of the chieftains eyeing the boy It is I the boy answered And he told what he had seen Why would the desert reveal such things to a stranger when it knows that we have been here for generations said another of the chieftains Because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not see And also because I know about the Soul of the World he thought to himself The oasis is neutral ground No one attacks an oasis said a third chieftain I can only tell you what I saw If you dont want to believe me you dont have to do anything about it The men fell into an animated discussion They spoke in an Arabic dialect that the boy didnt understand but when he made to leave the guard told him to stay The boy became fearful the omens told him that something was wrong He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert Suddenly the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly and the boy felt better The man hadnt participated in the discussion and in fact hadnt said a word up to that point But the boy was already used to the Language of the World and he could feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming The discussion ended The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man was saying Then he turned to the boy this time his expression was cold and distant Two thousand years ago in a distant land a man who believed in dreams was thrown into a dungeon and then sold as a slave the old man said now in the dialect the boy understood Our merchants bought that man and brought him to Egypt All of us know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them The elder continued When the pharaoh dreamed of cows that were thin and cows that were fat this man Im speaking of rescued Egypt from famine His name was Joseph He too was a stranger in a strange land like you and he was probably about your age He paused and his eyes were still unfriendly We always observe the Tradition The Tradition saved Egypt from famine in those days and made the Egyptians the wealthiest of peoples The Tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry The Tradition says that an oasis is neutral territory because both sides have oases and so both are vulnerable No one said a word as the old man continued But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert Everything we know was taught to us by the desert The old man gave a signal and everyone stood The meeting was over The hookahs were extinguished and the guards stood at attention The boy made ready to leave but the old man spoke again Tomorrow we are going to break the agreement that says that no one at the oasis may carry arms Throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies When the sun sets the men will once again surrender their arms to me For every ten dead men among our enemies you will receive a piece of gold But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle Arms are as capricious as the desert and if they are not used the next time they might not function If at least one of them hasnt been used by the end of the day tomorrow one will be used on you When the boy left the tent the oasis was illuminated only by the light of the full moon He was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there He was alarmed by what had happened He had succeeded in reaching through to the Soul of the World and now the price for having done so might be his life It was a frightening bet But he had been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to pursue his destiny And as the camel driver had said to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day Every day was there to be lived or to mark ones departure from this world Everything depended on one word Maktub Walking along in the silence he had no regrets If he died tomorrow it would be because God was not willing to change the future He would at least have died after having crossed the strait after having worked in a crystal shop and after having known the silence of the desert and Fatimas eyes He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago If he died tomorrow he would already have seen more than other shepherds and he was proud of that Suddenly he heard a thundering sound and he was thrown to the ground by a wind such as he had never known The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view Before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream When the blinding dust had settled a bit the boy trembled at what he saw Astride the animal was a horseman dressed completely in black with a falcon perched on his left shoulder He wore a turban and his entire face except for his eyes was covered with a black kerchief He appeared to be a messenger from the desert but his presence was much more powerful than that of a mere messenger The strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks he demanded so loudly that his words seemed to echo through the fifty thousand palm trees of AlFayoum It is I who dared to do so said the boy He was reminded of the image of Santiago Matamoros mounted on his white horse with the infidels beneath his hooves This man looked exactly the same except that now the roles were reversed It is I who dared to do so he repeated and he lowered his head to receive a blow from the sword Many lives will be saved because I was able to see through to the Soul of the World The sword didnt fall Instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boys forehead It drew a droplet of blood The horseman was completely immobile as was the boy It didnt even occur to the boy to flee In his heart he felt a strange sense of joy he was about to die in pursuit of his destiny And for Fatima The omens had been true after all Here he was facetoface with his enemy but there was no need to be concerned about dyingthe Soul of the World awaited him and he would soon be a part of it And tomorrow his enemy would also be apart of that Soul The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boys forehead Why did you read the flight of the birds I read only what the birds wanted to tell me They wanted to save the oasis Tomorrow all of you will die because there are more men at the oasis than you have The sword remained where it was Who are you to change what Allah has willed Allah created the armies and he also created the hawks Allah taught me the language of the birds Everything has been written by the same hand the boy said remembering the camel drivers words The stranger withdrew the sword from the boys forehead and the boy felt immensely relieved But he still couldnt flee Be careful with your prognostications said the stranger When something is written there is no way to change it All I saw was an army said the boy I didnt see the outcome of the battle The stranger seemed satisfied with the answer But he kept the sword in his hand What is a stranger doing in a strange land I am following my destiny Its not something you would understand The stranger placed his sword in its scabbard and the boy relaxed I had to test your courage the stranger said Courage is the quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World The boy was surprised The stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about You must not let up even after having come so far he continued You must love the desert but never trust it completely Because the desert tests all men it challenges every step and kills those who become distracted What he said reminded the boy of the old king If the warriors come here and your head is still on your shoulders at sunset come and find me said the stranger The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip The horse reared again raising a cloud of dust Where do you live shouted the boy as the horseman rode away The hand with the whip pointed to the south The boy had met the alchemist Next morning there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout the palm trees at AlFayoum Before the sun had reached its high point five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north it appeared to be a peaceful expedition but they all carried arms hidden in their robes When they reached the white tent at the center of AlFayoum they withdrew their scimitars and rifles And they attacked an empty tent The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert and within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead The children had been kept at the other side of a grove of palm trees and saw nothing of what had happened The women had remained in their tents praying for the safekeeping of their husbands and saw nothing of the battle either Were it not for the bodies there on the ground it would have appeared to be a normal day at the oasis The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion That afternoon he was brought before the tribal chieftains who asked him why he had violated the Tradition The commander said that his men had been starving and thirsty exhausted from many days of battle and had decided to take the oasis so as to be able to return to the war The tribal chieftain said that he felt sorry for the tribesmen but that the Tradition was sacred He condemned the commander to death without honor Rather than being killed by a blade or a bullet he was hanged from a dead palm tree where his body twisted in the desert wind The tribal chieftain called for the boy and presented him with fifty pieces of gold He repeated his story about Joseph of Egypt and asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis When the sun had set and the first stars made their appearance the boy started to walk to the south He eventually sighted a single tent and a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited by genies But the boy sat down and waited Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view He carried two dead hawks over his shoulder I am here the boy said You shouldnt be here the alchemist answered Or is it your destiny that brings you here With the wars between the tribes its impossible to cross the desert So I have come here The alchemist dismounted from his horse and signaled that the boy should enter the tent with him It was a tent like many at the oasis The boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none There were only some books in a pile a small cooking stove and the carpets covered with mysterious designs Sit down Well have something to drink and eat these hawks said the alchemist The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen on the day before but he said nothing The alchemist lighted the fire and soon a delicious aroma filled the tent It was better than the scent of the hookahs Why did you want to see me the boy asked Because of the omens the alchemist answered The wind told me you would be coming and that you would need help Its not I the wind spoke about Its the other foreigner the Englishman Hes the one thats looking for you He has other things to do first But hes on the right track He has begun to try to understand the desert And what about me When a person really desires something all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream said the alchemist echoing the words of the old king The boy understood Another person was there to help him toward his destiny So you are going to instruct me No You already know all you need to know I am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure But theres a tribal war the boy reiterated I know whats happening in the desert I have already found my treasure I have a camel I have my money from the crystal shop and I have fifty gold pieces In my own country I would be a rich man But none of that is from the Pyramids said the alchemist I also have Fatima She is a treasure greater than anything else I have won She wasnt found at the Pyramids either They ate in silence The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boys cup It was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted Isnt wine prohibited here the boy asked Its not what enters mens mouths thats evil said the alchemist Its what comes out of their mouths that is The alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed After they finished eating they sat outside the tent under a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale Drink and enjoy yourself said the alchemist noticing that the boy was feeling happier Rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat Remember that wherever your heart is there you will find your treasure Youve got to find the treasure so that everything you have learned along the way can make sense Tomorrow sell your camel and buy a horse Camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire Then suddenly they kneel and die But horses tire bit by bit You always know how much you can ask of them and when it is that they are about to die The following night the boy appeared at the alchemists tent with a horse The alchemist was ready and he mounted his own steed and placed the falcon on his left shoulder He said to the boy Show me where there is life out in the desert Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure They began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way I dont know if Ill be able to find life in the desert the boy thought I dont know the desert that well yet He wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the man They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the hawks in the sky but now there was only silence and the wind I dont know how to find life in the desert the boy said I know that there is life here but I dont know where to look Life attracts life the alchemist answered And then the boy understood He loosened the reins on his horse who galloped forward over the rocks and sand The alchemist followed as the boys horse ran for almost half an hour They could no longer see the palms of the oasisonly the gigantic moon above them and its silver reflections from the stones of the desert Suddenly for no apparent reason the boys horse began to slow Theres life here the boy said to the alchemist I dont know the language of the desert but my horse knows the language of life They dismounted and the alchemist said nothing Advancing slowly they searched among the stones The alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground There was a hole there among the stones The alchemist put his hand into the hole and then his entire arm up to his shoulder Something was moving there and the alchemists eyesthe boy could see only his eyessquinted with his effort His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the hole Then with a motion that startled the boy he withdrew his arm and leaped to his feet In his hand he grasped a snake by the tail The boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist The snake fought frantically making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert It was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes Watch out for his venom the boy said But even though the alchemist had put his hand in the hole and had surely already been bitten his expression was calm The alchemist is two hundred years old the Englishman had told him He must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a scimitar With its blade he drew a circle in the sand and then he placed the snake within it The serpent relaxed immediately Not to worry said the alchemist He wont leave the circle You found life in the desert the omen that I needed Why was that so important Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert The boy didnt want to talk about the Pyramids His heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night To continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima Im going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said I want to stay at the oasis the boy answered Ive found Fatima and as far as Im concerned shes worth more than treasure Fatima is a woman of the desert said the alchemist She knows that men have to go away in order to return And she already has her treasure its you Now she expects that you will find what it is youre looking for Well what if I decide to stay Let me tell you what will happen Youll be the counselor of the oasis You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels Youll marry Fatima and youll both be happy for a year Youll learn to love the desert and youll get to know every one of the fifty thousand palms Youll watch them as they grow demonstrating how the world is always changing And youll get better and better at understanding omens because the desert is the best teacher there is Sometime during the second year youll remember about the treasure The omens will begin insistently to speak of it and youll try to ignore them Youll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do And your camels will bring you wealth and power During the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny Youll walk around night after night at the oasis and Fatima will be unhappy because shell feel it was she who interrupted your quest But you will love her and shell return your love Youll remember that she never asked you to stay because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man So you wont blame her But many times youll walk the sands of the desert thinking that maybe you could have left that you could have trusted more in your love for Fatima Because what kept you at the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back At that point the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever Then sometime during the fourth year the omens will abandon you because youve stopped listening to them The tribal chieftains will see that and youll be dismissed from your position as counselor But by then youll be a rich merchant with many camels and a great deal of merchandise Youll spend the rest of your days knowing that you didnt pursue your destiny and that now its too late You must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny If he abandons that pursuit its because it wasnt true love the love that speaks the Language of the World The alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks The boy remembered the crystal merchant who had always wanted to go to Mecca and the Englishman in search of the alchemist He thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert And he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved They mounted their horses and this time it was the boy who followed the alchemist back to the oasis The wind brought the sounds of the oasis to them and the boy tried to hear Fatimas voice But that night as he had watched the cobra within the circle the strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of love and treasure of the women of the desert and of his destiny Im going with you the boy said And he immediately felt peace in his heart Well leave tomorrow before sunrise was the alchemists only response The boy spent a sleepless night Two hours before dawn he awoke one of the boys who slept in his tent and asked him to show him where Fatima lived They went to her tent and the boy gave his friend enough gold to buy a sheep Then he asked his friend to go to into the tent where Fatima was sleeping and to awaken her and tell her that he was waiting outside The young Arab did as he was asked and was given enough gold to buy yet another sheep Now leave us alone said the boy to the young Arab The Arab returned to his tent to sleep proud to have helped the counselor of the oasis and happy at having enough money to buy himself some sheep Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent The two walked out among the palms The boy knew that it was a violation of the Tradition but that didnt matter to him now Im going away he said And I want you to know that Im coming back I love you because Dont say anything Fatima interrupted One is loved because one is loved No reason is needed for loving But the boy continued I had a dream and I met with a king I sold crystal and crossed the desert And because the tribes declared war I went to the well seeking the alchemist So I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you The two embraced It was the first time either had touched the other Ill be back the boy said Before this I always looked to the desert with longing said Fatima Now it will be with hope My father went away one day but he returned to my mother and he has always come back since then They said nothing else They walked a bit farther among the palms and then the boy left her at the entrance to her tent Ill return just as your father came back to your mother he said He saw that Fatimas eyes were filled with tears Youre crying Im a woman of the desert she said averting her face But above all Im a woman Fatima went back to her tent and when daylight came she went out to do the chores she had done for years But everything had changed The boy was no longer at the oasis and the oasis would never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday It would no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm trees and three hundred wells where the pilgrims arrived relieved at the end of their long journeys From that day on the oasis would be an empty place for her From that day on it was the desert that would be important She would look to it every day and would try to guess which star the boy was following in search of his treasure She would have to send her kisses on the wind hoping that the wind would touch the boys face and would tell him that she was alive That she was waiting for him a woman awaiting a courageous man in search of his treasure From that day on the desert would represent only one thing to her the hope for his return Dont think about what youve left behind the alchemist said to the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert Everything is written in the Soul of the World and there it will stay forever Men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said He was already reaccustomed to deserts silence If what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil And one can always come back If what you had found was only a moment of light like the explosion of a star you would find nothing on your return The man was speaking the language of alchemy But the boy knew that he was referring to Fatima It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind The desert with its endless monotony put him to dreaming The boy could still see the palm trees the wells and the face of the woman he loved He could see the Englishman at his experiments and the camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it Maybe the alchemist has never been in love the boy thought The alchemist rode in front with the falcon on his shoulder The bird knew the language of the desert well and whenever they stopped he flew off in search of game On the first day he returned with a rabbit and on the second with two birds At night they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden The desert nights were cold and were becoming darker and darker as the phases of the moon passed They went on for a week speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to avoid the battles between the tribes The war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood Battles had been fought nearby and the wind reminded the boy that there was the language of omens always ready to show him what his eyes had failed to observe On the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual The falcon flew off to find game and the alchemist offered his water container to the boy You are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist I congratulate you for having pursued your destiny And youve told me nothing along the way said the boy I thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know A while ago I rode through the desert with a man who had books on alchemy But I wasnt able to learn anything from them There is only one way to learn the alchemist answered Its through action Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey You need to learn only one thing more The boy wanted to know what that was but the alchemist was searching the horizon looking for the falcon Why are you called the alchemist Because thats what I am And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were unable to do so They were looking only for gold his companion answered They were seeking the treasure of their destiny without wanting actually to live out the destiny What is it that I still need to know the boy asked But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon And finally the falcon returned with their meal They dug a hole and lit their fire in it so that the light of the flames would not be seen Im an alchemist simply because Im an alchemist he said as he prepared the meal I learned the science from my grandfather who learned from his father and so on back to the creation of the world In those times the Master Work could be written simply on an emerald But men began to reject simple things and to write tracts interpretations and philosophical studies They also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had Yet the Emerald Tablet is still alive today What was written on the Emerald Tablet the boy wanted to know The alchemist began to draw in the sand and completed his drawing in less than five minutes As he drew the boy thought of the old king and the plaza where they had met that day it seemed as if it had taken place years and years ago This is what was written on the Emerald Tablet said the alchemist when he had finished The boy tried to read what was written in the sand Its a code said the boy a bit disappointed It looks like what I saw in the Englishmans books No the alchemist answered Its like the flight of those two hawks it cant be understood by reason alone The Emerald Tablet is a direct passage to the Soul of the World The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect God created the world so that through its visible objects men could understand his spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom Thats what I mean by action Should I understand the Emerald Tablet the boy asked Perhaps if you were in a laboratory of alchemy this would be the right time to study the best way to understand the Emerald Tablet But you are in the desert So immerse yourself in it The desert will give you an understanding of the world in fact anything on the face of the earth will do that You dont even have to understand the desert all you have to do is contemplate a simple grain of sand and you will see in it all the marvels of creation How do I immerse myself in the desert Listen to your heart It knows all things because it came from the Soul of the World and it will one day return there They crossed the desert for another two days in silence The alchemist had become much more cautious because they were approaching the area where the most violent battles were being waged As they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart It was not easy to do in earlier times his heart had always been ready to tell its story but lately that wasnt true There had been times when his heart spent hours telling of its sadness and at other times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy of treasure and more slowly when the boy stared entranced at the endless horizons of the desert But his heart was never quiet even when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence Why do we have to listen to our hearts the boy asked when they had made camp that day Because wherever your heart is that is where youll find your treasure But my heart is agitated the boy said It has its dreams it gets emotional and its become passionate over a woman of the desert It asks things of me and it keeps me from sleeping many nights when Im thinking about her Well thats good Your heart is alive Keep listening to what it has to say During the next three days the two travelers passed by a number of armed tribesmen and saw others on the horizon The boys heart began to speak of fear It told him stories it had heard from the Soul of the World stories of men who sought to find their treasure and never succeeded Sometimes it frightened the boy with the idea that he might not find his treasure or that he might die there in the desert At other times it told the boy that it was satisfied it had found love and riches My heart is a traitor the boy said to the alchemist when they had paused to rest the horses It doesnt want me to go on That makes sense the alchemist answered Naturally its afraid that in pursuing your dream you might lose everything youve won Well then why should I listen to my heart Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet Even if you pretend not to have heard what it tells you it will always be there inside you repeating to you what youre thinking about life and about the world You mean I should listen even if its treasonous Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly If you know your heart well it will never be able to do that to you Because youll know its dreams and wishes and will know how to deal with them You will never be able to escape from your heart So its better to listen to what it has to say That way youll never have to fear an unanticipated blow The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert He came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was He lost his fear and forgot about his need to go back to the oasis because one afternoon his heart told him that it was happy Even though I complain sometimes it said its because Im the heart of a person and peoples hearts are that way People are afraid to pursue their most important dreams because they feel that they dont deserve them or that theyll be unable to achieve them We their hearts become fearful just thinking of loved ones who go away forever or of moments that could have been good but werent or of treasures that might have been found but were forever hidden in the sands Because when these things happen we suffer terribly My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams because every second of the search is a seconds encounter with God and with eternity Every second of the search is an encounter with God the boy told his heart When I have been truly searching for my treasure every day has been luminous because Ive known that every hour was a part of the dream that I would find it When I have been truly searching for my treasure Ive discovered things along the way that I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve So his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon That night the boy slept deeply and when he awoke his heart began to tell him things that came from the Soul of the World It said that all people who are happy have God within them And that happiness could be found in a grain of sand from the desert as the alchemist had said Because a grain of sand is a moment of creation and the universe has taken millions of years to create it Everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him his heart said We peoples hearts seldom say much about those treasures because people no longer want to go in search of them We speak of them only to children Later we simply let life proceed in its own direction toward its own fate But unfortunately very few follow the path laid out for themthe path to their destinies and to happiness Most people see the world as a threatening place and because they do the world turns out indeed to be a threatening place So we their hearts speak more and more softly We never stop speaking out but we begin to hope that our words wont be heard we dont want people to suffer because they dont follow their hearts Why dont peoples hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams the boy asked the alchemist Because thats what makes a heart suffer most and hearts dont like to suffer From then on the boy understood his heart He asked it please never to stop speaking to him He asked that when he wandered far from his dreams his heart press him and sound the alarm The boy swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its message That night he told all of this to the alchemist And the alchemist understood that the boys heart had returned to the Soul of the World So what should I do now the boy asked Continue in the direction of the Pyramids said the alchemist And continue to pay heed to the omens Your heart is still capable of showing you where the treasure is Is that the one thing I still needed to know No the alchemist answered What you still need to know is this before a dream is realized the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way It does this not because it is evil but so that we can in addition to realizing our dreams master the lessons weve learned as weve moved toward that dream Thats the point at which most people give up Its the point at which as we say in the language of the desert one dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon Every search begins with beginners luck And every search ends with the victors being severely tested The boy remembered an old proverb from his country It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn On the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared Three armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there Im hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered Were going to have to search you to see whether youre armed one of the tribesmen said The alchemist dismounted slowly and the boy did the same Why are you carrying money asked the tribesman when he had searched the boys bag I need it to get to the Pyramids he said The tribesman who was searching the alchemists belongings found a small crystal flask filled with a liquid and a yellow glass egg that was slightly larger than a chickens egg What are these things he asked Thats the Philosophers Stone and the Elixir of Life Its the Master Work of the alchemists Whoever swallows that elixir will never be sick again and a fragment from that stone turns any metal into gold The Arabs laughed at him and the alchemist laughed along They thought his answer was amusing and they allowed the boy and the alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings Are you crazy the boy asked the alchemist when they had moved on What did you do that for To show you one of lifes simple lessons the alchemist answered When you possess great treasures within you and try to tell others of them seldom are you believed They continued across the desert With every day that passed the boys heart became more and more silent It no longer wanted to know about things of the past or future it was content simply to contemplate the desert and to drink with the boy from the Soul of the World The boy and his heart had become friends and neither was capable now of betraying the other When his heart spoke to him it was to provide a stimulus to the boy and to give him strength because the days of silence there in the desert were wearisome His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were his courage in having given up his sheep and in trying to live out his destiny and his enthusiasm during the time he had worked at the crystal shop And his heart told him something else that the boy had never noticed it told the boy of dangers that had threatened him but that he had never perceived His heart said that one time it had hidden the rifle the boy had taken from his father because of the possibility that the boy might wound himself And it reminded the boy of the day when he had been ill and vomiting out in the fields after which he had fallen into a deep sleep There had been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boys sheep and murder him But since the boy hadnt passed by they had decided to move on thinking that he had changed his route Does a mans heart always help him the boy asked the alchemist Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies But they do help children drunkards and the elderly too Does that mean that Ill never run into danger It means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said One afternoon they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful white robes with arms at the ready The men were smoking their hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield No one paid any attention to the two travelers Theres no danger the boy said when they had moved on past the encampment The alchemist sounded angry Trust in your heart but never forget that youre in the desert When men are at war with one another the Soul of the World can hear the screams of battle No one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun All things are one the boy thought And then as if the desert wanted to demonstrate that the alchemist was right two horsemen appeared from behind the travelers You cant go any farther one of them said Youre in the area where the tribes are at war Im not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen They were silent for a moment and then agreed that the boy and the alchemist could move along The boy watched the exchange with fascination You dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said Your eyes show the strength of your soul answered the alchemist Thats true the boy thought He had noticed that in the midst of the multitude of armed men back at the encampment there had been one who stared fixedly at the two He had been so far away that his face wasnt even visible But the boy was certain that he had been looking at them Finally when they had crossed the mountain range that extended along the entire horizon the alchemist said that they were only two days from the Pyramids If were going to go our separate ways soon the boy said then teach me about alchemy You already know about alchemy It is about penetrating to the Soul of the World and discovering the treasure that has been reserved for you No thats not what I mean Im talking about transforming lead into gold The alchemist fell as silent as the desert and answered the boy only after they had stopped to eat Everything in the universe evolved he said And for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest Dont ask me why I dont know why I just know that the Tradition is always right Men have never understood the words of the wise So gold instead of being seen as a symbol of evolution became the basis for conflict There are many languages spoken by things the boy said There was a time when for me a camels whinnying was nothing more than whinnying Then it became a signal of danger And finally it became just a whinny again But then he stopped The alchemist probably already knew all that I have known true alchemists the alchemist continued They locked themselves in their laboratories and tried to evolve as gold had And they found the Philosophers Stone because they understood that when something evolves everything around that thing evolves as well Others stumbled upon the stone by accident They already had the gift and their souls were readier for such things than the souls of others But they dont count Theyre quite rare And then there were the others who were interested only in gold They never found the secret They forgot that lead copper and iron have their own destinies to fulfill And anyone who interferes with the destiny of another thing never will discover his own The alchemists words echoed out like a curse He reached over and picked up a shell from the ground This desert was once a sea he said I noticed that the boy answered The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear He had done that many times when he was a child and had heard the sound of the sea The sea has lived on in this shell because thats its destiny And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water They mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the Pyramids of Egypt The sun was setting when the boys heart sounded a danger signal They were surrounded by gigantic dunes and the boy looked at the alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything But he appeared to be unaware of any danger Five minutes later the boy saw two horsemen waiting ahead of them Before he could say anything to the alchemist the two horsemen had become ten and then a hundred And then they were everywhere in the dunes They were tribesmen dressed in blue with black rings surrounding their turbans Their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing Even from a distance their eyes conveyed the strength of their souls And their eyes spoke of death The two were taken to a nearby military camp A soldier shoved the boy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a meeting with his staff These are the spies said one of the men Were just travelers the alchemist answered You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago And you were talking with one of the troops there Im just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars said the alchemist I have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes I was simply acting as a guide for my friend here Who is your friend the chief asked An alchemist said the alchemist He understands the forces of nature And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers The boy listened quietly And fearfully What is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men He has brought money to give to your tribe said the alchemist before the boy could say a word And seizing the boys bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief The Arab accepted them without a word There was enough there to buy a lot of weapons What is an alchemist he asked finally Its a man who understands nature and the world If he wanted to he could destroy this camp just with the force of the wind The men laughed They were used to the ravages of war and knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow Yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster They were men of the desert and they were fearful of sorcerers I want to see him do it said the chief He needs three days answered the alchemist He is going to transform himself into the wind just to demonstrate his powers If he cant do so we humbly offer you our lives for the honor of your tribe You cant offer me something that is already mine the chief said arrogantly But he granted the travelers three days The boy was shaking with fear but the alchemist helped him out of the tent Dont let them see that youre afraid the alchemist said They are brave men and they despise cowards But the boy couldnt even speak He was able to do so only after they had walked through the center of the camp There was no need to imprison them the Arabs simply confiscated their horses So once again the world had demonstrated its many languages the desert only moments ago had been endless and free and now it was an impenetrable wall You gave them everything I had the boy said Everything Ive saved in my entire life Well what good would it be to you if you had t6 die the alchemist answered Your money saved us for three days Its not often that money saves a persons life But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom He had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind He wasnt an alchemist The alchemist asked one of the soldiers for some tea and poured some on the boys wrists A wave of relief washed over him and the alchemist muttered some words that the boy didnt understand Dont give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice If you do you wont be able to talk to your heart But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind If a person is living out his destiny he knows everything he needs to know There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve the fear of failure Im not afraid of failing Its just that I dont know how to turn myself into the wind Well youll have to learn your life depends on it But what if I cant Then youll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny Thats a lot better than dying like millions of other people who never even knew what their destinies were But dont worry the alchemist continued Usually the threat of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives The first day passed There was a major battle nearby and a number of wounded were brought back to the camp The dead soldiers were replaced by others and life went on Death doesnt change anything the boy thought You could have died later on a soldier said to the body of one of his companions You could have died after peace had been declared But in any case you were going to die At the end of the day the boy went looking for the alchemist who had taken his falcon out into the desert I still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated Remember what I told you the world is only the visible aspect of God And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into contact with the material plane What are you doing Feeding my falcon If Im not able to turn myself into the wind were going to die the boy said Why feed your falcon Youre the one who may die the alchemist said I already know how to turn myself into the wind On the second day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp The sentinels allowed him to go they had already heard about the sorcerer who could turn himself into the wind and they didnt want to go near him In any case the desert was impassable He spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over the desert and listening to his heart The boy knew the desert sensed his fear They both spoke the same language On the third day the chief met with his officers He called the alchemist to the meeting and said Lets go see the boy who turns himself into the wind Lets the alchemist answered The boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day He told them all to be seated Its going to take a while the boy said Were in no hurry the chief answered We are men of the desert The boy looked out at the horizon There were mountains in the distance And there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible There was the desert that he had wandered for so many months despite all that time he knew only a small part of it Within that small part he had found an Englishman caravans tribal wars and an oasis with fifty thousand palm trees and three hundred wells What do you want here today the desert asked him Didnt you spend enough time looking at me yesterday Somewhere you are holding the person I love the boy said So when I look out over your sands I am also looking at her I want to return to her and I need your help so that I can turn myself into the wind What is love the desert asked Love is the falcons flight over your sands Because for him you are a green field from which he always returns with game He knows your rocks your dunes and your mountains and you are generous to him The falcons beak carries bits of me myself the desert said For years I care for his game feeding it with the little water that I have and then I show him where the game is And one day as I enjoy the fact that his game thrives on my surface the falcon dives out of the sky and takes away what Ive created But thats why you created the game in the first place the boy answered To nourish the falcon And the falcon then nourishes man And eventually man will nourish your sands where the game will once again flourish Thats how the world goes So is that what love is Yes thats what love is Its what makes the game become the falcon the falcon become man and man in his turn the desert Its what turns lead into gold and makes the gold return to the earth I dont understand what youre talking about the desert said But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands there is a woman waiting for me And thats why I have to turn myself into the wind The desert didnt answer him for a few moments Then it told him Ill give you my sands to help the wind to blow but alone I cant do anything You have to ask for help from the wind A breeze began to blow The tribesmen watched the boy from a distance talking among themselves in a language that the boy couldnt understand The alchemist smiled The wind approached the boy and touched his face It knew of the boys talk with the desert because the winds know everything They blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die Help me the boy said One day you carried the voice of my loved one to me Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the wind My heart the boy answered The wind has many names In that part of the world it was called the sirocco because it brought moisture from the oceans to the east In the distant land the boy came from they called it the levanter because they believed that it brought with it the sands of the desert and the screams of the Moorish wars Perhaps in the places beyond the pastures where his sheep lived men thought that the wind came from Andalusia But actually the wind came from no place at all nor did it go to any place thats why it was stronger than the desert Someone might one day plant trees in the desert and even raise sheep there but never would they harness the wind You cant be the wind the wind said Were two very different things Thats not true the boy said I learned the alchemists secrets in my travels I have inside me the winds the deserts the oceans the stars and everything created in the universe We were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul I want to be like you able to reach every corner of the world cross the seas blow away the sands that cover my treasure and carry the voice of the woman I love I heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said He said that everything has its own destiny But people cant turn themselves into the wind Just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds The winds curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before It wanted to talk about those things but it didnt know how to turn a man into the wind And look how many things the wind already knew how to do It created deserts sank ships felled entire forests and blew through cities filled with music and strange noises It felt that it had no limits yet here was a boy saying that there were other things the wind should be able to do This is what we call love the boy said seeing that the wind was close to granting what he requested When you are loved you can do anything in creation When you are loved theres no need at all to understand whats happening because everything happens within you and even men can turn themselves into the wind As long as the wind helps of course The wind was a proud being and it was becoming irritated with what the boy was saying It commenced to blow harder raising the desert sands But finally it had to recognize that even making its way around the world it didnt know how to turn a man into the wind And it knew nothing about love In my travels around the world Ive often seen people speaking of love and looking toward the heavens the wind said furious at having to acknowledge its own limitations Maybe its better to ask heaven Well then help me do that the boy said Fill this place with a sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun Then I can look to heaven without blinding myself So the wind blew with all its strength and the sky was filled with sand The sun was turned into a golden disk At the camp it was difficult to see anything The men of the desert were already familiar with that wind They called it the simum and it was worse than a storm at sea Their horses cried out and all their weapons were filled with sand On the heights one of the commanders turned to the chief and said Maybe we had better end this They could barely see the boy Their faces were covered with the blue cloths and their eyes showed fear Lets stop this another commander said I want to see the greatness of Allah the chief said with respect I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had expressed their fear As soon as the wind stopped he was going to remove them from their commands because true men of the desert are not afraid The wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun If you know about love you must also know about the Soul of the World because its made of love From where I am the sun said I can see the Soul of the World It communicates with my soul and together we cause the plants to grow and the sheep to seek out shade From where I amand Im a long way from the earthI learned how to love I know that if I came even a little bit closer to the earth everything there would die and the Soul of the World would no longer exist So we contemplate each other and we want each other and I give it life and warmth and it gives me my reason for living So you know about love the boy said And I know the Soul of the World because we have talked at great length to each other during this endless trip through the universe It tells me that its greatest problem is that up until now only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one That theres no need for iron to be the same as copper or copper the same as gold Each performs its own exact function as a unique being and everything would be a symphony of peace if the hand that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation But there was a sixth day the sun went on You are wise because you observe everything from a distance the boy said But you dont know about love If there hadnt been a sixth day man would not exist copper would always be just copper and lead just lead Its true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized So each thing has to transform itself into something better and to acquire a new destiny until someday the Soul of the World becomes one thing only The sun thought about that and decided to shine more brightly The wind which was enjoying the conversation started to blow with greater force so that the sun would not blind the boy This is why alchemy exists the boy said So that everyone will search for his treasure find it and then want to be better than he was in his former life Lead will play its role until the world has no further need for lead and then lead will have to turn itself into gold Thats what alchemists do They show that when we strive to become better than we are everything around us becomes better too Well why did you say that I dont know about love the sun asked the boy Because its not love to be static like the desert nor is it love to roam the world like the wind And its not love to see everything from a distance like you do Love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the World When I first reached through to it I thought the Soul of the World was perfect But later I could see that it was like other aspects of creation and had its own passions and wars It is we who nourish the Soul of the World and the world we live in will be either better or worse depending on whether we become better or worse And thats where the power of love comes in Because when we love we always strive to become better than we are So what do you want of me the sun asked I want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered Nature knows me as the wisest being in creation the sun said But I dont know how to turn you into the wind Then whom should I ask The sun thought for a minute The wind was listening closely and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the suns wisdom had its limitations That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the World Speak to the hand that wrote all said the sun The wind screamed with delight and blew harder than ever The tents were being blown from their ties to the earth and the animals were being freed from their tethers On the cliff the men clutched at each other as they sought to keep from being blown away The boy turned to the hand that wrote all As he did so he sensed that the universe had fallen silent and he decided not to speak A current of love rushed from his heart and the boy began to pray It was a prayer that he had never said before because it was a prayer without words or pleas His prayer didnt give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures it didnt ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal and it didnt beseech that the woman he had met continue to await his return In the silence the boy understood that the desert the wind and the sun were also trying to understand the signs written by the hand and were seeking to follow their paths and to understand what had been written on a single emerald He saw that omens were scattered throughout the earth and in space and that there was no reason or significance attached to their appearance he could see that not the deserts nor the winds nor the sun nor people knew why they had been created But that the hand had a reason for all of this and that only the hand could perform miracles or transform the sea into a desert or a man into the wind Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work The boy reached through to the Soul of the World and saw that it was a part of the Soul of God And he saw that the Soul of God was his own soul And that he a boy could perform miracles The simum blew that day as it had never blown before For generations thereafter the Arabs recounted the legend of a boy who had turned himself into the wind almost destroying a military camp in defiance of the most powerful chief in the desert When the simum ceased to blow everyone looked to the place where the boy had been But he was no longer there he was standing next to a sandcovered sentinel on the far side of the camp The men were terrified at his sorcery But there were two people who were smiling the alchemist because he had found his perfect disciple and the chief because that disciple had understood the glory of God The following day the general bade the boy and the alchemist farewell and provided them with an escort party to accompany them as far as they chose They rode for the entire day Toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a Coptic monastery The alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp From here on you will be alone the alchemist said You are only three hours from the Pyramids Thank you said the boy You taught me the Language of the World I only invoked what you already knew The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery A monk dressed in black came to the gates They spoke for a few minutes in the Coptic tongue and the alchemist bade the boy enter I asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist smiled They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery The alchemist lighted the fire and the monk brought him some lead which the alchemist placed in an iron pan When the lead had become liquid the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg He scraped from it a sliver as thin as a hair wrapped it in wax and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted The mixture took on a reddish color almost the color of blood The alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool As he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars I think theyre going to last for a long time he said to the monk The monk was irritated The caravans had been stopped at Giza for some time waiting for the wars to end But Gods will be done the monk said Exactly answered the alchemist When the pan had cooled the monk and the boy looked at it dazzled The lead had dried into the shape of the pan but it was no longer lead It was gold Will I learn to do that someday the boy asked This was my destiny not yours the alchemist answered But I wanted to show you that it was possible They returned to the gates of the monastery There the alchemist separated the disk into four parts This is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk Its for your generosity to the pilgrims But this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded Dont say that again Life might be listening and give you less the next time The alchemist turned to the boy This is for you To make up for what you gave to the general The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had given the general But he kept quiet because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk And this is for me said the alchemist keeping one of the parts Because I have to return to the desert where there are tribal wars He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk This is for the boy If he ever needs it But Im going in search of my treasure the boy said Im very close to it now And Im certain youll find it the alchemist said Then why this Because you have already lost your savings twice Once to the thief and once to the general Im an old superstitious Arab and I believe in our proverbs Theres one that says Everything that happens once can never happen again But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time They mounted their horses I want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist The boy brought his horse closer In ancient Rome at the time of Emperor Tiberius there lived a good man who had two sons One was in the military and had been sent to the most distant regions of the empire The other son was a poet and delighted all of Rome with his beautiful verses One night the father had a dream An angel appeared to him and told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and repeated throughout the world for all generations to come The father woke from his dream grateful and crying because life was generous and had revealed to him something any father would be proud to know Shortly thereafter the father died as he tried to save a child who was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot Since he had lived his entire life in a manner that was correct and fair he went directly to heaven where he met the angel that had appeared in his dream You were always a good man the angel said to him You lived your life in a loving way and died with dignity I can now grant you any wish you desire Life was good to me the man said When you appeared in my dream I felt that all my efforts had been rewarded because my sons poems will be read by men for generations to come I dont want anything for myself But any father would be proud of the fame achieved by one whom he had cared for as a child and educated as he grew up Sometime in the distant future I would like to see my sons words The angel touched the mans shoulder and they were both projected far into the future They were in an immense setting surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language The man wept with happiness I knew that my sons poems were immortal he said to the angel through his tears Can you please tell me which of my sons poems these people are repeating The angel came closer to the man and with tenderness led him to a bench nearby where they sat down The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in Rome the angel said Everyone loved them and enjoyed them But when the reign of Tiberius ended his poems were forgotten The words youre hearing now are those of your son in the military The man looked at the angel in surprise Your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion He was just and good One afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die Your son had heard of a rabbi who was able to cure illnesses and he rode out for days and days in search of this man Along the way he learned that the man he was seeking was the Son of God He met others who had been cured by him and they instructed your son in the mans teachings And so despite the fact that he was a Roman centurion he converted to their faith Shortly thereafter he reached the place where the man he was looking for was visiting He told the man that one of his servants was gravely ill and the rabbi made ready to go to his house with him But the centurion was a man of faith and looking into the eyes of the rabbi he knew that he was surely in the presence of the Son of God And this is what your son said the angel told the man These are the words he said to the rabbi at that point and they have never been forgotten My Lord I am not worthy that you should come under my roof But only speak a word and my servant will be healed The alchemist said No matter what he does every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world And normally he doesnt know it The boy smiled He had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd Goodbye the alchemist said Goodbye said the boy The boy rode along through the desert for several hours listening avidly to what his heart had to say It was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden Where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him But his heart was speaking of other things With pride it told the story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had on two different occasions It told of destiny and of the many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful women confronting the people of their times with their preconceived notions It spoke of journeys discoveries books and change As he was about to climb yet another dune his heart whispered Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears Thats where I am and thats where your treasure is The boy climbed the dune slowly A full moon rose again in the starry sky it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis The moonlight cast shadows through the dunes creating the appearance of a rolling sea it reminded the boy of the day when that horse had reared in the desert and he had come to know the alchemist And the moon fell on the deserts silence and on a mans journey in search of treasure When he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt There illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the desert stood the solemn and majestic Pyramids of Egypt The boy fell to his knees and wept He thanked God for making him believe in his destiny and for leading him to meet a king a merchant an Englishman and an alchemist And above all for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his destiny If he wanted to he could now return to the oasis go back to Fatima and live his life as a simple shepherd After all the alchemist continued to live in the desert even though he understood the Language of the World and knew how to transform lead into gold He didnt need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone The boy told himself that on the way toward realizing his own destiny he had learned all he needed to know and had experienced everything he might have dreamed of But here he was at the point of finding his treasure and he reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has been achieved The boy looked at the sands around him and saw that where his tears had fallen a scarab beetle was scuttling through the sand During his time in the desert he had learned that in Egypt the scarab beetles are a symbol of God Another omen The boy began to dig into the dune As he did so he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said that anyone could build a pyramid in his backyard The boy could see now that he couldnt do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life Throughout the night the boy dug at the place he had chosen but found nothing He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had been built But he didnt stop He struggled to continue digging as he fought the wind which often blew the sand back into the excavation His hands were abraded and exhausted but he listened to his heart It had told him to dig where his tears fell As he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered he heard footsteps Several figures approached him Their backs were to the moonlight and the boy could see neither their eyes nor their faces What are you doing here one of the figures demanded Because he was terrified the boy didnt answer He had found where his treasure was and was frightened at what might happen Were refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said What are you hiding there Im not hiding anything the boy answered But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole Another who was searching the boys bags found the piece of gold Theres gold here he said The moon shone on the face of the Arab who had seized him and in the mans eyes the boy saw death Hes probably got more gold hidden in the ground They made the boy continue digging but he found nothing As the sun rose the men began to beat the boy He was bruised and bleeding his clothing was torn to shreds and he felt that death was near What good is money to you if youre going to die Its not often that money can save someones life the alchemist had said Finally the boy screamed at the men Im digging for treasure And although his mouth was bleeding and swollen he told his attackers that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of Egypt The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the others Leave him He doesnt have anything else He must have stolen this gold The boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious The leader shook him and said Were leaving But before they left he came back to the boy and said Youre not going to die Youll live and youll learn that a man shouldnt be so stupid Two years ago right here on this spot I had a recurrent dream too I dreamed that I should travel to the fields of Spain and look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept In my dream there was a sycamore growing out of the ruins of the sacristy and I was told that if I dug at the roots of the sycamore I would find a hidden treasure But Im not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream And they disappeared The boy stood up shakily and looked once more at the Pyramids They seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy Because now he knew where his treasure was EPILOGUE The boy reached the small abandoned church just as night was falling The sycamore was still there in the sacristy and the stars could still be seen through the halfdestroyed roof He remembered the time he had been there with his sheep it had been a peaceful night except for the dream Now he was here not with his flock but with a shovel He sat looking at the sky for a long time Then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some He remembered the night in the desert when he had sat with the alchemist as they looked at the stars and drank wine together He thought of the many roads he had traveled and of the strange way God had chosen to show him his treasure If he hadnt believed in the significance of recurrent dreams he would not have met the Gypsy woman the king the thief or Well its a long list But the path was written in the omens and there was no way I could go wrong he said to himself He fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high He began to dig at the base of the sycamore You old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky You knew the whole story You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could get back to this church The monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters Couldnt you have saved me from that No he heard a voice on the wind say If I had told you you wouldnt have seen the Pyramids Theyre beautiful arent they The boy smiled and continued digging Half an hour later his shovel hit something solid An hour later he had before him a chest of Spanish gold coins There were also precious stones gold masks adorned with red and white feathers and stone statues embedded with jewels The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago forgotten and that some conquistador had failed to tell his children about The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag He had used the two stones only once one morning when he was at a marketplace His life and his path had always provided him with enough omens He placed Urim and Thummim in the chest They were also a part of his new treasure because they were a reminder of the old king whom he would never see again Its true life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny the boy thought Then he remembered that he had to get to Tarifa so he could give onetenth of his treasure to the Gypsy woman as he had promised Those Gypsies are really smart he thought Maybe it was because they moved around so much The wind began to blow again It was the levanter the wind that came from Africa It didnt bring with it the smell of the desert nor the threat of Moorish invasion Instead it brought the scent of a perfume he knew well and the touch of a kissa kiss that came from far away slowly slowly until it rested on his lips The boy smiled It was the first time she had done that Im coming Fatima he said 23072024 0547 China Network Systems China Network Security Situation DSI Blog httpsesmtberlinfacultyresearchdsibloginsidechinasCyberSYINASCYBERSECURITY LANDSCAPE

role the Ministry of Public Security MPS is responsible for the release of the relevant How to report or review the direct instructions of specific types of informationIt commands the Chinese Police Department Team responsible for implementing laws and regulations and carried out targeted work on high priority issues moveFor example it supervises the Golden Shield Project and the national

strive to reorganize the structure of the organization so that responsibilities no longer scattered in many different institutions The duties of bureaucratic duties of network security and privacy are still diverse and conflicted with each other The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology the Ministry of Public Security TC260 and the Internet information department in standards regulations

ability of the PLA Theory is increasingly intertwinedFor example the PLA network forces are also a main participation In the abroad we conducting network operations engaged in economic spy activities abroad or with various types APT is closely linkedIt also regards network space action as an important part of the information warfare point In summary the Chinese Communist Party has largely participated in various stages of the network governance system Moreover the reorganization and expansion of the network governance system are basically completedBut cannot be ruled out New development and upgrading of bureaucracy and key technology areas For example a new one The data management agency was divided into a further reorganization of the State Council in early 2023 standIt will be responsible for coordinating and promoting the construction of the data element system coordinating the data resources Comprehensive sharing development and utilization coordinate the promotion of digital China digital economy and digital society Construction planning and constructionIn this way the data will be used as the Fifth Most Normal FactorIn addition the same Driven by the

comprehensive governance system Although the Cyber Security Law is the core it is allowed Maximum data control and increased the risk of intellectual property theft have been criticizedthis In addition its wording and definition are quite vague which has increased the governments need to make a wide range of louds of investigation The reason for the clearness has reduced the ability of foreign companies to challenge government data accessPlace These documents involve digital economy and security issues such as security review and key Infrastructure protection online content management encryption and data flowThis governance system makes China has the opportunity to go hand in hand with Europe and has powerful data and security governance models Other countries are even using laws similar to China thus bringing communication and adding Risk of strong dictatorship In addition the Wuzhen Internet Conference has been held once a year since 2014 which is the CCP propaganda network Important platform for the concept of linked problemThe meeting is used to discuss Internet issues and policies The opportunity to provide the rules of network space for various countries just as Xi Jinping meets The concept of network sovereignty proposed on itThis kind of understanding is dominated by the West It is running running from the Internet concept because it will allow countries to have the final in digital space authorityIt will establish a national border in network space to prevent the free flow of information and make The Internet is more likely to be controlled and achieve digital authoritarianismTherefore China is seeking Form the network space according to your own concept at the global level such as entering through the United Nations Cheng for example the Guidelines for International Conduct proposed to the United Nations in 2011 proposed to the United Nations Or proposed new IP and other proposals proposed at the 2019 Internet Telecommunications Alliance meeting We are witnessing the rapid rise of China as a strong science and technology country its ability is continuously enhanced But it has not yet dominatedBeijings ambitions also have its limitations lack of talent and creation Newly come to achieve these strategic goals and dependence on foreign technology is highChina One measure taken by the government to overcome these obstacles is the establishment of national network security in 2017 centerIt consists of seven research talent development and entrepreneurial centersOvercoming this challenge Another important aspect of becoming a desire to become a big country of the Internet is economic diplomatic workers Global activities with China Science and Technology Corporation such as the Digital Silk RoadChinese technology The company plays an increasingly important role in this regardThese projects are seeking a new city The Chinese company promoted by the field and supports the government to obtain economic strategic and political influence AmbitionFor these reasons the government provides finances for these companies and their innovative projects Support and invested huge sums of money mainly focusing on emerging technologies such as 5G AI and semiconductors In addition the new government attaches more importance to national security and control which will also affect technical politics StrategyA recent report of ASPI warned that although China has not yet had technical advantages But it has laid the foundation for leading key technologies in the future in extensive fields such as artificial intelligence foundationThis prediction seems to be reasonable because innovation and self sufficient self sufficiency are China Strategic focus as President Xi Jinping said in 2018 Independent innovation is the only reason Road To be the leader of the world technologyOverview of the network governance system is to achieve all this The cornerstone of some goalsTherefore understand it for analyzing China as a network space participant And its ambition is crucial Network and digital diplomacy Network security 23072 Tools c2 GithubP3nt4NuagesAModularC2Framework Bypass
