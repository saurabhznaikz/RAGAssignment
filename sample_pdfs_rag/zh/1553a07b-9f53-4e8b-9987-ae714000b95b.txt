Figure 1: Disciplinary framework of institutional network governance.

China's network policy is directed by Xi Jinping himself from top to bottom.

The letter office also has supervision responsibilities, responsible for network content control and network operators related to promise
Can be procedures.Therefore, it supervises five subordinate organizations: Technical Committee 260 (TC260)
Responsible for technical information security standards.It is estimated that since 2015, the TC260 has been released
About 300 items.From an official perspective, it is an independent organization, but
There is a clear connection with the Internet Information Office.It consists of seven regular working groups, focusing on different
Network security issues.Foreign companies can participate in some of them, but the other one
Some working groups are only for Chinese officials and representatives of Chinese technology companies.These standards bring
Many challenges have become increasingly difficult for foreign companies to carry out business in China.middle

Technical center, but close contact with government agencies.China Internet Information Center
(CNNIC) also belongs to the jurisdiction of the Internet Information Office, responsible for supervision. CN top domain names and Mandarin

Internet finance and other issues.Internationally, ISC is self -positioning as the non -political environment in China
Government and multi -interest related organizations, but in fact it plays a supervision role.
Although strive to reorganize the structure of the organization, so that responsibilities no longer scattered in many different institutions,

In addition, other departments often participate in network issues: specialized technical institutions, support education
The department of research and the financial department of China Digital Strategy.In addition, even though in China
Digital technology policies are largely civil privileges, but its ability and the PLA's ability and the ability of the PLA
Theory is increasingly intertwined.For example, the PLA network forces are also a main participation
In the abroad, we conducting network operations, engaged in economic spy activities abroad, or with various types
APT is closely linked.It also regards network space action as an important part of the information warfare
point.
In summary, the Chinese Communist Party has largely participated in various stages of the network governance system.
Moreover, the reorganization and expansion of the network governance system are basically completed.But, cannot be ruled out
New development and upgrading of bureaucracy and key technology areas: For example, a new one
The data management agency was divided into a further reorganization of the State Council in early 2023

Driven by the government's security concerns, the goal of "localization" of technology is even more emphasized (the purpose
The standard is to achieve technical self -sufficiency by 2035 and become the world's top innovators).to this end,
National innovation and research are increasingly promoted.It is expected that the new government will strengthen the Ministry of Science and Technology
(MOST) The role of supervision and policy in pursuing the success of science and technology.
In addition, the private sector also plays an important role in the field of network security in China, especially
It is the largest ICT companies such as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, as well as industry associations
Alliance.They are at the forefront of China's global ambitions, especially in China
The international network ambitious recipe for accuracy, influence global digital order and realization of technology self -reliance

Finally, the governance system is related to the interrelated policies, laws, policies, regulations and standards

The most comprehensive governance system. "Although the" Cyber ​​Security Law "is the core, it is allowed
Maximum data control and increased the risk of intellectual property theft have been criticized.this
In addition, its wording and definition are quite vague, which has increased the government's need to make a wide range of louds of investigation.
The reason for the clearness has reduced the ability of foreign companies to challenge government data access.Place
These documents involve digital economy and security issues, such as security review and key
Infrastructure protection, online content management, encryption and data flow.This governance system makes
China has the opportunity to go hand in hand with Europe and has powerful data and security governance models.
Other countries are even using laws similar to China, thus bringing communication and adding
Risk of strong dictatorship.
In addition, the Wuzhen Internet Conference has been held once a year since 2014, which is the CCP propaganda network
Important platform for the concept of linked problem.The meeting is used to discuss Internet issues and policies.
The opportunity to provide the rules of network space for various countries, just as Xi Jinping meets
The concept of network sovereignty proposed on it.This kind of understanding is dominated by the West
It is running running from the Internet concept, because it will allow countries to have the final in digital space
authority.It will establish a national border in network space to prevent the free flow of information and make
The Internet is more likely to be controlled and achieve "digital authoritarianism."Therefore, China is seeking
Form the network space according to your own concept at the global level, such as entering through the United Nations
Cheng, for example, the "Guidelines for International Conduct" proposed to the United Nations in 2011, proposed to the United Nations,
Or proposed "new IP" and other proposals proposed at the 2019 Internet Telecommunications Alliance meeting.

But it has not yet dominated.Beijing's ambitions also have its limitations: lack of talent and creation
Newly come to achieve these strategic goals, and dependence on foreign technology is high.China
One measure taken by the government to overcome these obstacles is the establishment of national network security in 2017
center.It consists of seven research, talent development and entrepreneurial centers.Overcoming this challenge
Another important aspect of becoming a desire to become a big country of the Internet is economic diplomatic workers
Global activities with China Science and Technology Corporation, such as the "Digital Silk Road".Chinese technology
The company plays an increasingly important role in this regard.These projects are seeking a new city
The Chinese company promoted by the field and supports the government to obtain economic, strategic and political influence
Ambition.For these reasons, the government provides finances for these companies and their innovative projects
Support and invested huge sums of money, mainly focusing on emerging technologies such as 5G, AI and semiconductors.
In addition, the new government attaches more importance to (national) security and control, which will also affect technical politics
Strategy.A recent report of ASPI warned that although China has not yet had technical advantages,
But it has laid the foundation for leading key technologies in the future in extensive fields such as artificial intelligence
foundation.This prediction seems to be reasonable, because innovation and self -sufficient self -sufficiency are China.
Strategic focus, as President Xi Jinping said in 2018: "Independent innovation is the only reason
Road ... To be the leader of the world technology."Overview of the network governance system is to achieve all this
The cornerstone of some goals.Therefore, understand it for analyzing China as a network space participant
And its ambition is crucial.
